### Goal
Train an LLM that can think more creatively to solve harder reasoning problems.

### Plan
- Create a dataset of step-wise solutions to math questions where each step is more like open-ended brainstorming that eventually leads to an answer.
- Train an LLM using process supervision on this dataset
- Show improvement on GSMK or MATH benchmarks

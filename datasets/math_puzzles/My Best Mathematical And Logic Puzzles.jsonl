{"problem": "The Returning Explorer}\n\nAN OLD RIDDLE runs as follows. An explorer walks one mile due south, turns and walks one mile due east, turns again and walks one mile due north. He finds himself back where he started. He shoots a bear. What color is the bear? The time-honored answer is: \"White,\" because the explorer must have started at the North Pole. But not long ago someone made the discovery that the North Pole is not the only starting point that satisfies the given conditions! Can you think of any other spot on the globe from which one could walk a mile south, a mile east, a mile north and find himself back at his original location?", "solution": "Move 3,4 to the right of 5 but separated from 5 by a gap equal to the width of two coins."}
{"problem": "Draw Poker}\n\nTwo MEN PLAY a game of draw poker in the following curious manner. They spread a deck of 52 cards face up on the table so that they can see all the cards. The first player draws a hand by picking any five cards he chooses. The second player does the same. The first player now may keep his original hand or draw up to five cards. His discards are put aside out of the game. The second player may now draw likewise. The person with the higher hand then wins. Suits have equal value, so that two flushes tie unless one is made of higher cards. After a while the players discover that the first player can always win if he draws his first hand correctly. What hand must this be?", "solution": "Move 1,2 to the right of 3,4 , with coins 4 and 1 touching."}
{"problem": "The Mutilated Chessboard}\n\nTHE PROPS FOR this problem are a chessboard and 32 dominoes. Each domino is of such size that it exactly covers two adjacent squares on the board. The 32 dominoes therefore can cover all 64 of the chessboard squares. But now suppose we cut off two squares at diagonally opposite corners of the board and discard one of the dominoes. Is it possible to place the 31 dominoes on the board so that all the remaining 62 squares are covered? If so, show how it can be done.

{"problem": "The Fork in the Road}\n\nHere's a ReCENt twist on an old type of logic puzzle. A logician vacationing in the South Seas finds himself on an island inhabited by the two proverbial tribes of liars and truth-tellers. Members of one tribe always tell the truth, members of the other always lie. He comes to a fork in a road and has to ask a native bystander which branch he should take to reach a village. He has no way of telling whether the native is a truth-teller or a liar. The logician thinks a moment, then asks one question only. From the reply he knows which road to take. What question does he ask?", "solution": "Move 5,4 to the gap between 3 and 2 ."}

{"problem": "Bronx vs. Brooklyn}\n\nA young MaN lives in Manhattan near a subway express station. He has two girl friends, one in Brooklyn, one in The Bronx. To visit the girl in Brooklyn he takes a train on the downtown side\nof the platform; to visit the girl in The Bronx he takes a train on the uptown side of the same platform. Since he likes both girls equally well, he simply takes the first train that comes along. In this way he lets chance determine whether he rides to The Bronx or to Brooklyn. The young man reaches the subway platform at a random moment each Saturday afternoon. Brooklyn and Bronx trains arrive at the station equally often-every 10 minutes. Yet for some obscure reason he finds himself spending most of his time with the girl in Brooklyn: in fact on the average he goes there nine times out of ten. Can you think of a good reason why the odds so heavily favor Brooklyn?", "solution": "Pulls \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to right."}
{"problem": "The Early Commuter}\n\nA COMMUTER is in the habit of arriving at his suburban station each evening exactly at five o'clock. His wife always meets the train and drives him home. One day he takes an earlier train, arriving at the station at four. The weather is pleasant, so instead of telephoning home he starts walking along the route always taken by his wife. They meet somewhere on the way. He gets into the car and they drive home, arriving at their house ten minutes earlier than usual. Assuming that the wife always drives at a constant speed, and that on this occasion she left just in time to meet the five o'clock train, can you determine how long the husband walked before he was picked up?", "solution": "Pushes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to top. \\(A\\) is unhooked from \\(B\\)."}

{"problem": "How Many Children?}\n\n\"I HEAR some youngsters playing in the backyard,\" said Jones, a graduate student in mathematics. \"Are they all yours?\"\n\n\"Heavens, no,\" exclaimed Professor Smith, the eminent number theorist. \"My children are playing with friends from three other families in the neighborhood, although our family happens to be largest. The Browns have a smaller number of\nchildren, the Greens have a still smaller number, and the Blacks the smallest of all.\"\n\n\"How many children are there altogether?\" asked Jones.\n\n\"Let me put it this way,\" said Smith. \"There are fewer than 18 children, and the product of the numbers in the four families happens to be my house number which you saw when you arrived.\"\n\nJones took a notebook and pencil from his pocket and started scribbling. A moment later he looked up and said, \"I need more information. Is there more than one child in the Black family?\"\n\nAs soon as Smith replied, Jones smiled and correctly stated the number of children in each family.\n\nKnowing the house number and whether the Blacks had more than one child, Jones found the problem trivial. It is a remarkable fact, however, that the number of children in each family can be determined solely on the basis of the information given above!", "solution": "When Jones began to work on the professor's problem he knew that each of the four families had a different number of children, and that the total number was less than 18 . He further knew that the product of the four numbers gave the professor's house number. Therefore his obvious first step was to factor the house number into four different numbers which together would total less than 18 . If there had been only one way to do this, he would have immediately solved the problem. Since he could not solve it without further information, we conclude that there must have been more than one way of factoring the house number.\n\nOur next step is to write down all possible combinations of four different numbers which total less than 18 , and obtain the products of each group. We find that there are many cases where more than one combination gives the same product. How do we decide which product is the house number?\n\nThe clue lies in the fact that Jones asked if there was more than one child in the smallest family. This question is meaningful only if the house number is 120 , which can be factored as \\(1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 8,1 \\times 4 \\times\\) \\(5 \\times 6\\), or \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 4 \\times 5\\). Had Smith answered \"No,\" the problem would remain unsolved. Since Jones did solve it, we know the answer was \"Yes.\" The families therefore contained 2, 3, 4 and 5 children.\n\nThis problem was originated by Lester \\(\\mathrm{R}\\). Ford and published in the American Mathematical Monthly, March 1948, as Problem E776."}

{"problem": "The Flight around the World}\n\nA GROUP of airplanes is based on a small island. The tank of each plane holds just enough fuel to take it halfway around the world. Any desired amount of fuel can be transferred from the tank of one plane to the tank of another while the planes are in flight. The only source of fuel is on the island, and for the purposes of the problem it is assumed that there is no time lost in refueling either in the air or on the ground.\n\nWhat is the smallest number of planes that will ensure the flight of one plane around the world on a great circle, assuming that the planes have the same constant ground speed and rate of fuel consumption and that all planes return safely to their island base?", "solution": "Three airplanes are quite sufficient to ensure the flight of one plane around the world. There are many ways this can be done, but the following seems to be the most efficient. It uses only five tanks of\nfuel, allows the pilots of two planes sufficient time for a cup of coffee and a sandwich before refueling at the base, and there is a pleasing symmetry in the procedure.\n\nPlanes A, B and C take off together. After going \\(1 / 8\\) of the distance, C transfers \\(1 / 4\\) tank to \\(A\\) and \\(1 / 4\\) to \\(B\\). This leaves \\(C\\) with \\(1 / 4\\) tank, just enough to get back home.\n\nPlanes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) continue another \\(1 / 8\\) of the way, then \\(B\\) transfers \\(1 / 4\\) tank to \\(A\\). B now has \\(1 / 2\\) tank left, which is sufficient to get him back to the base where he arrives with an empty tank.\n\nPlane A, with a full tank, continues until it runs out of fuel \\(1 / 4\\) of the way from the base. It is met by \\(C\\) which has been refueled at the base. C transfers \\(1 / 4\\) tank to \\(A\\), and both planes head for home.\n\nThe two planes run out of fuel 1/8 of the way from the base, where they are met by refueled plane B.

{"problem": "The Repetitious Number}\n\nAN UNUSUAL parlor trick is performed as follows. Ask spectator A to jot down any three-digit number, and then to repeat the digits in the same order to make a six-digit number (e.g., 394,394). With your back turned so that you cannot see the number, ask \\(A\\) to pass the sheet of paper to spectator \\(B\\), who is requested to divide the number by 7 .\n\n\"Don't worry about the remainder,\" you tell him, \"because there won't be any.\" \\(B\\) is surprised to discover that you are right (e.g., 394,394 divided by 7 is 56,342 ). Without telling you the result, he passes it on to spectator \\(\\mathrm{C}\\), who is told to divide it by 11. Once again you state that there will be no remainder, and this also proves correct \\((56,342\\) divided by 11 is 5,122\\()\\).\n\nWith your back still turned, and no knowledge whatever of the figures obtained by these computations, you direct a fourth spectator, D, to divide the last result by 13 . Again the division comes out even ( 5,122 divided by 13 is 394 ). This final result is written on a slip of paper which is folded and handed to you. Without opening it you pass it on to spectator A.\n\n\"Open this,\" you tell him, \"and you will find your original three-digit number.\"\n\nProve that the trick cannot fail to work regardless of the digits chosen by the first spectator.", "solution": "Writing a three-digit number twice is the same as multiplying it by 1,001 . This number has the factors 7,11 and 13 , so writing the chosen number twice is equivalent to multiplying it by 7,11 and 13 . Naturally when the product is successively divided by these same three numbers, the final remainder will be the original number.\n\nI presented this classical trick before hand and desk calculators became omnipresent.

{"problem": "Handshakes and Networks}\n\nProve that at a recent convention of biophysicists the number of scientists in attendance who shook hands an odd number of times is even. The same problem can be expressed graphically as follows. Put as many dots (biophysicists) as you wish on a sheet of paper. Draw as many lines (handshakes) as you wish from any dot to any other dot. A dot can \"shake hands\" as often as you please, or not at all. Prove that the number of dots with an odd number of lines joining them is even.", "solution": "Because two people are involved in every handshake, the total score for everyone at the convention will be evenly divisible by two and therefore even. The total score for the men who shook hands an even number of times is, of course, also even. If we subtract this even score from the even total score of the convention, we get an even total score for those men who shook hands an odd number of times. Only an even number of odd numbers will total an even number, so we conclude that an even number of men shook hands an odd number of times.\n\nThere are other ways to prove the theorem; one of the best was sent to me by Gerald K. Schoenfeld, a medical officer in the U.S. Navy. At the start of the convention, before any handshakes have occurred, the number of persons who have shaken hands an odd number of times will be 0 . The first handshake produces two \"odd persons.\" From now on, handshakes are of three types: between two even persons, two odd persons, or one odd and one even person. Each even-even shake increases the number of odd persons by 2 . Each odd-odd shake decreases the number of odd persons by 2 . Each odd-even shake changes an odd person to even and an even person to odd, leaving the number of odd persons unchanged. There is no way, therefore, that the even number of odd persons can shift its parity; it must remain at all times an even number.\n\nBoth proofs apply to a graph of dots on which lines are drawn to connect pairs of dots. The lines form a network on which the number of dots that mark the meeting of an odd number of lines is even."}
{"problem": "The Triangular Duel}\n\nSmith, Brown and Jones agree to fight a pistol duel under the following unusual conditions. After drawing lots to determine who fires first, second and third, they take their places at the corners of an equilateral triangle. It is agreed that they will fire single shots in turn and continue in the same cyclic order until two of them are dead. At each turn the man who is firing may aim wherever he pleases. All three duelists know that Smith always hits his target, Brown is 80 per cent accurate and Jones is 50 per cent accurate.\n\nAssuming that all three adopt the best strategy, and that no one is killed by a wild shot not intended for him, who has the best chance to survive? A more difficult question: What are the exact survival probabilities of the three men?", "solution": "In the triangular pistol duel the poorest shot, Jones, has the best chance to survive. Smith, who never misses, has the second best\nchance. Because Jones's two opponents will aim at each other when their turns come, Jones's best strategy is to fire into the air until one opponent is dead. He will then get the first shot at the survivor, which gives him a strong advantage.\n\nSmith's survival chances are the easiest to determine. There is a chance of \\(1 / 2\\) that he will get the first shot in his duel with Brown, in which case he kills him. There is a chance of \\(1 / 2\\) that Brown will shoot first, and since Brown is \\(4 / 5\\) accurate, Smith has a \\(1 / 5\\) chance of surviving. So Smith's chance of surviving Brown is \\(1 / 2\\) added to \\(1 / 2 \\times\\) \\(1 / 5=3 / 5\\). Jones, who is accurate half the time, now gets a crack at Smith. If he misses, Smith kills him, so Smith has a survival chance of \\(1 / 2\\) against Jones. Smith's over-all chance of surviving is therefore \\(3 / 5 \\times 1 / 2=3 / 10\\).\n\nBrown's case is more complicated because we run into an infinite series of possibilities. His chance of surviving against Smith is \\(2 / 5\\) (we saw above that Smith's survival chance against Brown was \\(3 / 5\\), and since one of the two men must survive, we subtract \\(3 / 5\\) from 1 to obtain Brown's chance of surviving against Smith). Brown now faces fire from Jones. There is a chance of \\(1 / 2\\) that Jones will miss, in which case Brown has a \\(4 / 5\\) chance of killing Jones. Up to this point, then, his chance of killing Jones is \\(1 / 2 \\times 4 / 5=4 / 10\\). But there is a \\(1 / 5\\) chance that Brown may miss, giving Jones another shot. Brown's chance of surviving is \\(1 / 2\\); then he has a \\(4 / 5\\) chance of killing Jones again, so his chance of surviving on the second round is \\(1 / 2 \\times 1 / 5 \\times 1 / 2 \\times 4 / 5=\\) \\(4 / 100\\).\n\nIf Brown misses again, his chance of killing Jones on the third round will be \\(4 / 1,000\\); if he misses once more, his chance on the fourth round will be \\(4 / 10,000\\), and so on. Brown's total survival chance against Jones is thus the sum of the infinite series:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{10}+\\frac{4}{100}+\\frac{4}{1,000}+\\frac{4}{10,000} \\cdots\n\\]\n\nThis can be written as the repeating decimal \\(.444444 \\ldots\\). ., which is the decimal expansion of \\(4 / 9\\).\n\nAs we saw earlier, Brown had a \\(2 / 5\\) chance of surviving Smith; now we see that he has a \\(4 / 9\\) chance to survive Jones. His over-all survival chance is therefore \\(2 / 5 \\times 4 / 9=8 / 45\\).\n\nJones's survival chance can be determined in similar fashion, but of course we can get it immediately by subtracting Smith's chance, \\(3 / 10\\), and Brown's chance, \\(8 / 45\\), from 1 . This gives Jones an over-all survival chance of \\(47 / 90\\).\n\nThe entire duel can be conveniently graphed by using the tree diagram shown. It begins with only two branches because Jones passes if he has the first shot, leaving only two equal possibilities: Smith shooting first or Brown shooting first, with intent to kill. One branch of the tree goes on endlessly. The over-all survival chance of an individual is computed as follows:\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-53.jpg?height=896&width=1076&top_left_y=837&top_left_x=95)"}
{"problem": "Crossing the Desert}\n\nAN UNLIMITED supply of gasoline is available at one edge of a desert 800 miles wide, but there is no source on the desert itself. A truck can carry enough gasoline to go 500 miles (this will be called one \"load\"), and it can build up its own refueling stations at any spot along the way. These caches may be any size, and it is assumed that there is no evaporation loss.\n\nWhat is the minimum amount (in loads) of gasoline the truck will require in order to cross the desert? Is there a limit to the width of a desert the truck can cross?", "solution": "The following analysis of the desert-crossing problem appeared in an issue of Eureka, a publication of mathematics students at the University of Cambridge. Five hundred miles will be called a \"unit\"; gasoline sufficient to take the truck 500 miles will be called a \"load\"; and a \"trip\" is a journey of the truck in either direction from one stopping point to the next.\n\nTwo loads will carry the truck a maximum distance of 1 and \\(1 / 3\\) units. This is done in four trips by first setting up a cache at a spot \\(1 / 3\\) unit from the start. The truck begins with a full load, goes to the cache, leaves \\(1 / 3\\) load, returns, picks up another full load, arrives at the cache and picks up the cache's \\(1 / 3\\) load.

The truck returns, picks up the remaining full load and arrives at the first cache with \\(4 / 5\\) load in its tank. This, together with the fuel in the cache, makes two full loads, sufficient to carry the truck the remaining 1 and \\(1 / 3\\) units, as explained in the preceding paragraph.\n\nWe are asked for the minimum amount of fuel required to take the truck 800 miles. Three loads will take it 766 and \\(2 / 3\\) miles ( 1 and \\(1 / 3\\) plus \\(1 / 5\\) units), so we need a third cache at a distance of 33 and \\(1 / 3\\) miles (1/15 unit) from the start. In five trips the truck can build up this cache so that when the truck reaches the cache at the end of the seventh trip, the combined fuel of truck and cache will be three loads. As we have seen, this is sufficient to take the truck the remaining distance of 766 and \\(2 / 3\\) miles. Seven trips are made between starting point and first cache, using 7/15 load of gasoline. The three loads of fuel that remain are just sufficient for the rest of the way, so the total amount of gasoline consumed will be 3 and \\(7 / 15\\), or a little more than 3.46 loads. Sixteen trips are required.\n\nProceeding along similar lines, four loads will take the truck a distance of 1 and \\(1 / 3\\) plus \\(1 / 5\\) plus \\(1 / 7\\) units, with three caches located at the boundaries of these distances. The sum of this infinite series diverges as the number of loads increases; therefore the truck can cross a desert of any width. If the desert is 1,000 miles across, seven caches, 64 trips and 7.673 loads of gasoline are required.\n\nHundreds of letters were received on this problem, giving general solutions and interesting sidelights. Cecil G. Phipps, professor of mathematics at the University of Florida, summed matters up succinctly as follows:\n\n\"The general solution is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nd=m(1+1 / 3+1 / 5+1 / 7+\\ldots)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(d\\) is the distance to be traversed and \\(m\\) is the number of miles per load of gasoline. The number of depots to be established is one less than the number of terms in the series needed to exceed the value of \\(d\\). One load of gasoline is used in the travel between each pair of stations. Since the series is divergent, any distance can be reached by this method although the amount of gasoline needed increases exponentially.\n\n\"If the truck is to return eventually to its home station, the formula becomes:\n\n\\[\nd=m(1 / 2+1 / 4+1 / 6+1 / 8+\\ldots)\n\\]\n\nThis series is also divergent and the solution has properties similar to those for the one-way trip.\"\n\nMany readers called attention to three previously published discussions of the problem:\n\n\"The Jeep Problem: A More General Solution.\" C.

(Surely his story \"The Three Sailors' Gambit\u201d is the funniest chess fantasy ever written.) Not generally known is the fact that he liked to invent bizarre chess problems which, like his fiction, combine humor and fantasy.\n\nThe problem depicted here was contributed by Dunsany to The Week-End Problems Book, compiled by Hubert Phillips. Its solution calls more for logical thought than skill at chess, although one does have to know the rules of the game. White is to play and mate in four moves. The position is one that could occur in actual play.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-14.jpg?height=602&width=615&top_left_y=750&top_left_x=310)", "solution": "The key to Lord Dunsany's chess problem is the fact that the black queen is not on a black square as she must be at the start of a game. This means that the black king and queen have moved, and this could have happened only if some black pawns have moved. Pawns cannot move backward, so we are forced to conclude that the black\npawns reached their present positions from the other side of the board! With this in mind, it is easy to discover that the white knight on the right has an easy mate in four moves.\n\nWhite's first move is to jump his knight at the lower right corner of the board to the square just above his king. If black moves the upper left knight to the rook's file, white mates in two more moves. Black can, however, delay the mate one move by first moving his knight to the bishop's file instead of the rook's. White jumps his knight forward and right to the bishop's file, threatening mate on the next move. Black moves his knight forward to block the mate. White takes the knight with his queen, then mates with his knight on the fourth move."}
{"problem": "The Lonesome 8}\n\nThe most popular problem ever published in The American Mathematical Monthly, its editors recently disclosed, is the following. It was contributed by P. L. Chessin of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation to the April 1954 issue.\n\n\"Our good friend and eminent numerologist, Professor Euclide Paracelso Bombasto Umbugio, has been busily engaged in testing on his desk calculator the \\(81 \\times 10^{9}\\) possible solutions to\nthe problem of reconstructing the following exact long division in which the digits were indiscriminately replaced by \\(x\\) save in the quotient where they were almost entirely omitted:\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-15.jpg?height=431&width=490&top_left_y=343&top_left_x=306)\n\n\"Deflate the Professor!

The 8 is in correct position above the line, making it the third digit of a five digit-answer. The problem is easier than it looks, yielding readily to a few elementary insights.", "solution": "In long division, when two digits are brought down instead of one, there must be a zero in the quotient. This occurs twice, so we know at once that the quotient is \\(x 080 x\\). When the divisor is multiplied by the quotient's last digit, the product is a four-digit number. The quotient's last digit must therefore be 9 , because eight times the divisor is a three-digit number.\n\nThe divisor must be less than 125 because eight times 125 is 1,000 , a four-digit number. We now can deduce that the quotient's first digit must be more than 7 , for seven times a divisor less than 125 would give a product that would leave more than two digits after it was subtracted from the first four digits in the dividend. This first digit cannot be 9 (which gives a four-digit number when the divisor is multiplied by it), so it must be 8 , making the full quotient 80809 .\n\nThe divisor must be more than 123 because 80809 times 123 is a seven-digit number and our dividend has eight digits. The only number between 123 and 125 is 124 . We can now reconstruct the entire problem as follows:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{r}\n80809 \\\\\n\\hline 124 \\\\\n\\hline 9920316 \\\\\n\\hline 1003 \\\\\n992 \\\\\n\\hline 1116 \\\\\n1116\n\\end{tabular}"}

{"problem": "Water and Wine}\n\nA familiar chestnut concerns two beakers, one containing water, the other wine. A certain amount of water is transferred to the wine, then the same amount of the mixture is transferred back to the water. Is there now more water in the wine than there is wine in the water? The answer is that the two quantities are the same.\n\nRaymond Smullyan writes to raise the further question: Assume that at the outset one beaker holds 10 ounces of water and the other holds 10 ounces of wine. By transferring three ounces back and forth any number of times, stirring after each transfer, is it possible to reach a point at which the percentage of wine in each mixture is the same?", "solution": "Regardless of how much wine is in one beaker and how much water is in the other, and regardless of how much liquid is transferred back and forth at each step (provided it is not all of the liquid in one beaker), it is impossible to reach a point at which the percentage of wine in each mixture is the same. This can be shown by a simple inductive argument. If beaker \\(A\\) contains a higher concentration of wine than beaker \\(B\\), then a transfer from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) will leave \\(A\\) with the higher concentration. Similarly a transfer from \\(B\\) to A-from a weaker to a stronger mixture-is sure to leave B weaker. Since every transfer is one of these two cases, it follows that beaker \\(A\\) must always contain a mixture with a higher percentage of wine than \\(B\\). The only way to equalize the concentrations is by pouring all of one beaker into the other."}
{"problem": "The Absent-Minded Teller}\n\nAN ABSENT-MINDED bank teller switched the dollars and cents when he cashed a check for Mr. Brown, giving him dollars instead of cents, and cents instead of dollars. After buying a five-cent newspaper, Brown discovered that he had left exactly twice as much as his original check. What was the amount of the check?", "solution": "To determine the value of Brown's check, let \\(x\\) stand for the dollars and \\(y\\) for the cents. The problem can now be expressed by the following equation: \\(100 y+x-5=2(100 x+y)\\). This reduces to \\(98 y-199 x=5\\), a Diophantine equation with an infinite number of integral solutions. A solution by the standard method of continued fractions gives as the lowest values in positive integers: \\(x=31\\) and \\(y=\\) 63 , making Brown's check \\(\\$ 31.63\\). This is a unique answer to the problem because the next lowest values are: \\(x=129, y=262\\), which fails to meet the requirement that \\(y\\) be less than 100 .\n\nThere is a much simpler approach to the problem and many readers wrote to tell me about it. As before, let \\(x\\) stand for the dollars on the check, \\(y\\) for the cents. After buying his newspaper, Brown has left \\(2 x+2 y\\). The change that he has left, from the \\(x\\) cents given him by the cashier, will be \\(x-5\\).\n\nWe know that \\(y\\) is less than 100 , but we don't know yet whether it is less than 50 cents. If it is less than 50 cents, we can write the following equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n2 x=y \\\\\n2 y=x-5\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\n\nIf \\(y\\) is 50 cents or more, then Brown will be left with an amount of cents \\((2 y)\\) that is a dollar or more. We therefore have to modify the above equations by taking 100 from \\(2 y\\) and adding 1 to \\(2 x\\). The equations become:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n2 x+1=y \\\\\n2 y-100=x-5\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\n\nEach set of simultaneous equations is easily solved. The first set gives \\(x\\) a minus value, which is ruled out. The second set gives the correct values."}
{"problem": "Acute Dissection}\n\nGiven a triangle with one obtuse angle, is it possible to cut the triangle into smaller triangles, all of them acute? (An acute triangle is a triangle with three acute angles. A right angle is of course neither acute nor obtuse.) If this cannot be done, give a proof of impossibility. If it can be done, what is the smallest number of acute triangles into which any obtuse triangle can be dissected?\n\nThe illustration shows a typical attempt that leads nowhere. The triangle has been divided into three acute triangles, but the fourth is obtuse, so nothing has been gained by the preceding cuts.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-17.jpg?height=519&width=878&top_left_y=1180&top_left_x=186)\n\nThe problem (which came to me by way of Mel Stover of Winnipeg) is amusing because even the best mathematician is\nlikely to be led astray by it and come to a wrong conclusion. My pleasure in working on it led me to ask myself a related question: \"What is the smallest number of acute triangles into which a square can be dissected?\" For days I was convinced that nine was the answer; then suddenly I saw how to reduce it to eight. I wonder how many readers can discover an eighttriangle solution, or perhaps an even better one. I am unable to prove that eight is the minimum, though I strongly suspect that it is.", "solution": "A number of readers sent \"proofs\" that an obtuse triangle cannot be dissected into acute triangles, but of course it can. The illustration shows a seven-piece pattern that applies to any obtuse triangle.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-59.jpg?height=402&width=694&top_left_y=354&top_left_x=278)\n\nIt is easy to see that seven is minimal. The obtuse angle must be divided by a line. This line cannot go all the way to the other side, for then it would form another obtuse triangle, which in turn would have to be dissected, consequently the pattern for the large triangle would not be minimal. The line dividing the obtuse angle must, therefore, terminate at a point inside the triangle. At this vertex, at least five lines must meet, otherwise the angles at this vertex would not all be acute. This creates the inner pentagon of five triangles, making a total of seven triangles in all. Wallace Manheimer, a Brooklyn high school teacher at the time, gave this proof as his solution to problem E1406 in American Mathematical Monthly, November 1960, page 923. He also showed how to construct the pattern for any obtuse triangle.\n\nThe question arises: Can any obtuse triangle be dissected into seven acute isosceles triangles? The answer is no. Verner E. Hoggatt, Jr., and Russ Denman (American Mathematical Monthly, November 1961, pages 912-913) proved that eight such triangles are sufficient for all obtuse triangles, and Free Jamison (ibid., June-July 1962, pages \\(550-552\\) ) proved that eight are also necessary. These articles can be consulted for details as to conditions under which less than eight-piece patterns are possible. A right triangle and an acute nonisosceles triangle can each be cut into nine acute isosceles triangles, and an acute isosceles triangle can be cut into four congruent acute isosceles triangles similar to the original.\n\nA square, I discovered, can be cut into eight acute triangles as shown. If the dissection has bilateral symmetry, points \\(P\\) and \\(P^{\\prime}\\) must\nlie within the shaded area determined by the four semicircles. Donald L. Vanderpool pointed out in a letter that asymmetric distortions of the pattern are possible with point \\(P\\) anywhere outside the shaded area provided it remains outside the two large semicircles.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-60.jpg?height=674&width=660&top_left_y=372&top_left_x=291)\n\nAbout 25 readers sent proofs, with varying degrees of formality, that the eight-piece dissection is minimal. One, by Harry Lindgren, appeared in Australian Mathematics Teacher, Vol. 18, pages 14-15, 1962. His proof also shows that the pattern, aside from the shifting of points \\(\\mathrm{P}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{P}^{\\prime}\\) as noted above, is unique.\n\nH. S. M. Coxeter pointed out the surprising fact that for any rectangle, even though its sides differ in length by an arbitrarily small amount, the line segment \\(\\mathrm{PP}^{\\prime}\\) can be shifted to the center to give the pattern both horizontal and vertical symmetry.\n\nFree Jamison found in 1968 that a square can be divided into ten acute isosceles triangles. See The Fibonacci Quarterly (December 1968) for a proof that a square can be dissected into any number of acute isosceles triangles equal or greater than 10 ."}
{"problem": "How Long Is a \"Lunar\"?}\n\nIN H. G. Wells's novel The First Men in the Moon our natural satellite is found to be inhabited by intelligent insect creatures who live in caverns below the surface. These creatures, let us assume, have a unit of distance that we shall call a \"lunar.\" It was adopted because the moon's surface area, if expressed in square lunars, exactly equals the moon's volume in cubic lunars. The moon's diameter is 2,160 miles. How many miles long is a lunar?", "solution": "The volume of a sphere is \\(4 \\pi / 3\\) times the cube of the radius. Its surface is \\(4 \\pi\\) times the square of the radius. If we express the moon's radius in \"lunars\" and assume that its surface in square lunars equals its volume in cubic lunars, we can determine the length of the radius\nsimply by equating the two formulas and solving for the value of the radius. \\(\\mathrm{Pi}\\) cancels out on both sides, and we find that the radius is three lunars. The moon's radius is 1,080 miles, so a lunar must be 360 miles."}
{"problem": "The Game of Googol}\n\nIN 1958 John H. Fox, Jr., of the Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Company, and L. Gerald Marnie, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, devised an unusual betting game which they call Googol. It is played as follows: Ask someone to take as many slips of paper as he pleases, and on each slip write a different positive number. The numbers may range from small fractions of 1 to a number the size of a \"googol\" (1 followed by a hundred 0 's) or even larger. These slips are turned face down and shuffled over the top of a table. One at a time you turn the slips face up. The aim is to stop turning when you come to the number that you guess to be the largest of the series. You cannot go back and pick a previously turned slip. If you turn over all the slips, then of course you must pick the last one turned.\n\nMost people will suppose the odds against your finding the highest number to be at least five to one. Actually if you adopt the best strategy, your chances are a little better than one in three. Two questions arise. First, what is the best strategy? (Note that this is not the same as asking for a strategy that will maximize the value of the selected number.) Second, if you follow this strategy, how can you calculate your chances of winning?\n\nWhen there are only two slips, your chance of winning is obviously \\(1 / 2\\), regardless of which slip you pick. As the slips increase in number, the probability of winning (assuming that you use the best strategy) decreases, but the curve flattens quickly, and there is very little change beyond ten slips. The probability never drops below \\(1 / 3\\). Many players will suppose that they can make the task more difficult by choosing very large numbers, but a little reflection will show that the sizes of the numbers are irrelevant. It is only necessary that the slips bear numbers that can be arranged in increasing order.\n\nThe game has many interesting applications. For example, a girl decides to marry before the end of the year. She estimates that she will meet ten men who can be persuaded to propose, but once she has rejected a proposal, the man will not try again. What strategy should she follow to maximize her chances of accepting the top man of the ten, and what is the probability that she will succeed?\n\nThe strategy consists of rejecting a certain number of slips of paper (or proposals), then picking the next number that exceeds the highest number among the rejected slips. What is needed is a formula for determining how many slips to reject, depending on the total number of slips.", "solution": "Regardless of the number of slips involved in the game of Googol, the probability of picking the slip with the largest number (assuming that the best strategy is used) never drops below . 367879. This is the reciprocal of \\(e\\), and the limit of the probability of winning as the number of slips approaches infinity.\n\nIf there are ten slips (a convenient number to use in playing the game), the probability of picking the top number is . 398 . The strategy is to turn three slips, note the largest number among them, then pick the next slip that exceeds this number. In the long run you stand to win about two out of every five games.\n\nWhat follows is a compressed account of a complete analysis of the game by Leo Moser and J. R. Pounder of the University of Alberta. Let \\(n\\) be the number of slips and \\(p\\) the number rejected before picking a number larger than any on the \\(p\\) slips. Number the slips serially from 1 to \\(n\\). Let \\(k+1\\) be the number of the slip bearing the largest number. The top number will not be chosen unless \\(k\\) is equal to or greater than \\(p\\) (otherwise it will be rejected among the first \\(p\\) slips), and then only if the highest number from 1 to \\(k\\) is also the highest number from 1 to \\(p\\) (otherwise this number will be chosen before the top number is reached). The probability of finding the top number in case it is on the \\(k+1\\) slip is \\(p / k\\), and the probability that the top number actually is on the \\(k+1\\) slip is \\(1 / n\\). Since the largest number can be on only one slip, we can write the following formula for the probability of finding it:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{p}{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{p+1}+\\frac{1}{p+2} \\cdots+\\frac{1}{n-1}\\right)\n\\]\n\nGiven a value for \\(n\\) (the number of slips) we can determine \\(p\\) (the number to reject) by picking a value for \\(p\\) that gives the greatest value to the above expression. As \\(n\\) approaches infinity, \\(p / n\\) approaches \\(1 / e\\), so a good estimate of \\(p\\) is simply the nearest integer to n/e. The general strategy, therefore, when the game is played with \\(n\\) slips, is to let n/e numbers go by, then pick the next number larger than the largest number on the n/e slips passed up.\n\nThis assumes, of course, that a player has no knowledge of the range of the numbers on the slips and therefore no basis for knowing whether a single number is high or low within the range. If one has\nsuch knowledge, the analysis does not apply. For example, if the game is played with the numbers on ten one-dollar bills, and your first draw is a bill with a number that begins with 9 , your best strategy is to keep the bill. For similar reasons, the strategy in playing Googol is not strictly applicable to the unmarried girl problem, as many readers pointed out, because the girl presumably has a fair knowledge of the range in value of her suitors, and has certain standards in mind. If the first man who proposes comes very close to her ideal, wrote Joseph P. Robinson, \"she would have rocks in her head if she did not accept at once.\"\n\nFox and Marnie apparently hit independently on a problem that had occurred to others a few years before. A number of readers said they had heard the problem before 1958-one recalled working on it in 1955-but I was unable to find any published reference to it. The problem of maximizing the value of the selected object (rather than the chance of getting the object of highest value) seems first to have been proposed by the famous mathematician Arthur Cayley in 1875. (See Leo Moser, \"On a Problem of Cayley,\" in Scripta Mathematica, September-December 1956, pages 289-292.)"}
{"problem": "Marching Cadets and a Trotting Dog}\n\nA square formation of Army cadets, 50 feet on the side, is marching forward at a constant pace. The company mascot, a small terrier, starts at the center of the rear rank [position A in the illustration], trots forward in a straight line to the center of the front rank [position \\(B\\) ], then trots back again in a straight\nline to the center of the rear.

(See More Mathematical Puzzles of Sam Loyd, Dover, 1960, page 103.) Instead of moving forward and back through the marching cadets, the mascot trots with constant speed around the outside of the square, keeping as close as possible to the square at all times. (For the problem we assume that he trots along the perimeter of the square.) As before, the formation has marched 50 feet by the time the dog returns to point \\(A\\). How long is the dog's path?", "solution": "Let 1 be the length of the square of cadets and also the time it takes them to march this length. Their speed will also be 1 . Let \\(x\\) be the total distance traveled by the dog and also its speed. On the dog's forward trip his speed relative to the cadets will be \\(x-1\\). On the return trip his speed relative to the cadets will be \\(x+1\\). Each trip is a distance of 1 (relative to the cadets), and the two trips are completed in unit time, so the following equation can be written:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x-1}+\\frac{1}{x+1}=1\n\\]\n\nThis can be expressed as the quadratic: \\(x^{2}-2 x-1=0\\), for which \\(x\\) has the positive value of \\(1+\\sqrt{2}\\).

In other words, the dog travels a total distance equal to the length of the square of cadets plus that same length times the square root of 2.\n\nLoyd's version of the problem, in which the dog trots around the moving square, can be approached in exactly the same way. I paraphrase a clear, brief solution sent by Robert \\(F\\). Jackson of the Computing Center at the University of Delaware.\n\nAs before, let 1 be the side of the square and also the time it takes the cadets to go 50 feet. Their speed will then also be 1 . Let \\(x\\) be the\ndistance traveled by the dog and also his speed. The dog's speed with respect to the speed of the square will be \\(x-1\\) on his forward trip, \\(\\sqrt{x^{2}-1}\\) on each of his two transverse trips, and \\(x+1\\) on his backward trip. The circuit is completed in unit time, so we can write this equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x-1}+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{x^{2}-1}}+\\frac{1}{x+1}=1\n\\]\n\nThis can be expressed as the quartic equation: \\(x^{4}-4 x^{3}-2 x^{2}+\\) \\(4 x+5=0\\). Only one positive real root is not extraneous: \\(4.18112+\\). We multiply this by 50 to get the desired answer: \\(209.056+\\) feet.\n\nTheodore W. Gibson, of the University of Virginia, found that the first form of the above equation can be written as follows, simply by taking the square root of each side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x-1}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+1}}=1\n\\]\n\nwhich is remarkably similar to the equation for the first version of the problem.\n\nMany readers sent analyses of variations of this problem: a square formation marching in a direction parallel to the square's diagonal, formations of regular polygons with more than four sides, circular formations, rotating formations, and so on. Thomas J. Meehan and David Salsburg each pointed out that the problem is the same as that of a destroyer making a square search pattern around a moving ship, and showed how easily it could be solved by vector diagrams on what the Navy calls a \"maneuvering board.\""}
{"problem": "White, Black and Brown}\n\nProfessor Merle White of the mathematics department, Professor Leslie Black of philosophy, and Jean Brown, a young stenographer who worked in the university's office of admissions, were lunching together.\n\n\"Isn't it remarkable,\" observed the lady, \"that our last names are Black, Brown and White and that one of us has black hair, one brown hair and one white.\"\n\n\"It is indeed,\" replied the person with black hair, \"and have you noticed that not one of us has hair that matches his or her name?\"\n\n\"By golly, you're right!\" exclaimed Professor White.\n\nIf the lady's hair isn't brown, what is the color of Professor Black's hair?", "solution": "The assumption that the \"lady\" is Jean Brown, the stenographer, quickly leads to a contradiction. Her opening remark brings forth a reply from the person with black hair, therefore Brown's hair cannot be black. It also cannot be brown, for then it would match her name. Therefore it must be white. This leaves brown for the color of Professor Black's hair and black for Professor White. But a statement by the person with black hair prompts an exclamation from White, so they cannot be the same person.\n\nIt is necessary to assume, therefore, that Jean Brown is a man. Professor White's hair can't be white (for then it would match his or her name), nor can it be black because he (or she) replies to the black-haired person. Therefore it must be brown. If the lady's hair\nisn't brown, then Professor White is not a lady. Brown is a man, so Professor Black must be the lady. Her hair can't be black or brown, so she must be a platinum blonde."}
{"problem": "The Plane in the Wind}\n\nAN AIRPLANE flies in a straight line from airport \\(A\\) to airport \\(B\\), then back in a straight line from \\(B\\) to \\(A\\). It travels with a constant engine speed and there is no wind. Will its travel time for the same round trip be greater, less or the same if, throughout both flights, at the same engine speed, a constant wind blows from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) ?", "solution": "Since the wind boosts the plane's speed from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) and retards it from \\(B\\) to \\(A\\), one is tempted to suppose that these forces balance each other so that total travel time for the combined flights will remain the same. This is not the case, because the time during which the plane's speed is boosted is shorter than the time during which it is retarded, so the over-all effect is one of retardation. The total travel time in a wind of constant speed and direction, regardless of the speed or direction, is always greater than if there were no wind."}
{"problem": "What Price Pets?}\n\nTHE OWNER of a pet shop bought a certain number of hamsters and half that many pairs of parakeets. He paid \\(\\$ 2\\) each for the hamsters and \\(\\$ 1\\) for each parakeet. On every pet he placed a retail price that was an advance of 10 per cent over what he paid for it.\n\nAfter all but seven of the creatures had been sold, the owner found that he had taken in for them an amount of money exactly equal to what he had originally paid for all of them. His potential profit, therefore, was represented by the combined retail value of the seven remaining animals. What was this value?", "solution": "Let \\(x\\) be the number of hamsters originally purchased and also the number of parakeets. Let \\(y\\) be the number of hamsters among the seven unsold pets. The number of parakeets among the seven will then be \\(7-y\\). The number of hamsters sold (at a price of \\(\\$ 2.20\\) each, which is a markup of 10 per cent over cost) will be \\(x-y\\), and the number of parakeets sold (at \\(\\$ 1.10\\) each) will be \\(x-7+y\\).\n\nThe cost of the pets is therefore \\(2 x\\) dollars for the hamsters and \\(x\\) dollars for the parakeets-a total of \\(3 x\\) dollars. The hamsters that were sold brought \\(2.2(x-y)\\) dollars and the parakeets sold brought 1.1 \\((x-7+y)\\) dollars-a total of \\(3.3 x-1.1 y-7.7\\) dollars.\n\nWe are told that these two totals are equal, so we equate them and simplify to obtain the following Diophantine equation with two integral unknowns:\n\n\\[\n3 x=11 y+77\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are positive integers and \\(y\\) is not more than 7, it is a simple matter to try each of the eight possible values (including zero) for \\(y\\) to determine which of them makes \\(x\\) also integral. There are only two such values: 5 and 2 . Each would lead to a solution of the problem were it not for the fact that the parakeets were bought in pairs. This eliminates 2 as a value for \\(y\\) because it would give \\(x\\) (the number of parakeets purchased) the odd value of 33 . We conclude therefore that \\(y\\) is 5 .\n\nA complete picture can now be drawn. The shop owner bought 44 hamsters and 22 pairs of parakeets, paying altogether \\(\\$ 132\\) for them. He sold 39 hamsters and 21 pairs of parakeets for a total of \\(\\$ 132\\). There remained five hamsters worth \\(\\$ 11\\) retail and two parakeets worth \\(\\$ 2.20\\) retail-a combined value of \\(\\$ 13.20\\), which is the answer to the problem."}
{"problem": "The Game of Hip}\n\nThe game of \"Hip,\" so named because of the hipster's reputed disdain for \"squares,\" is played on a six-by-six checkerboard as follows:\n\nOne player holds eighteen red counters; his opponent holds eighteen black counters. They take turns placing a single counter on any vacant cell of the board. Each tries to avoid placing his counters so that four of them mark the corners of a square. The square may be any size and tipped at any angle. There are 105 possible squares, four of which are shown in the illustration.\n\nA player wins when his opponent becomes a \"square\" by forming one of the 105 squares. The game can be played on a board with actual counters, or with pencil and paper. Simply draw the board, then register moves by marking X's and O's on the cells.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-22.jpg?height=825&width=817&top_left_y=732&top_left_x=232)\n\nFor months after I had devised this game I believed that it was impossible for a draw to occur in it. Then C. M. McLaury, a mathematics student at the University of Oklahoma, demonstrated that the game could end in a draw. The problem is to show how the game can be drawn by dividing the 36 cells into\ntwo sets of eighteen each so that no four cells of the same set mark the corners of a square.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-23.jpg?height=596&width=1196&top_left_y=421&top_left_x=27)\n\n", "solution": "The illustration shows the finish of a drawn game of Hip. This beautiful, hard-to-find solution was first discovered by C. M. McLaury, a mathematics student at the University of Oklahoma to whom I had communicated the problem by way of Richard Andree, one of his professors.\n\nTwo readers (William R. Jordan, Scotia, New York, and Donald L. Vanderpool, Towanda, Pennsylvania) were able to show, by an exhaustive enumeration of possibilities, that the solution is unique except for slight variations in the four border cells indicated by arrows. Each cell may be either color, provided all four are not the same color, but since each player is limited in the game to eighteen pieces, two of these cells must be one color, two the other color. They are arranged here so that no matter how the square is turned, the pattern is the same when inverted.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-65.jpg?height=781&width=758&top_left_y=764&top_left_x=244)\n\nThe order- 6 board is the largest on which a draw is possible. This was proved in 1960 by Robert I. Jewett, then a graduate student at the University of Oregon. He was able to show that a draw is impossible on the order- 7 , and since all higher squares contain a seven-by-seven subsquare, draws are clearly impossible on them also.\n\nAs a playable game, Hip on an order- 6 board is strictly for the squares. David \\(H\\). Templeton, professor of chemistry at the Univer-\nsity of California's Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, pointed out that the second player can always force a draw by playing a simple symmetry strategy. He can either make each move so that it matches his opponent's last move by reflection across a parallel bisector of the board, or by a 90 -degree rotation about the board's center. (The latter strategy could lead to the draw depicted.) An alternate strategy is to play in the corresponding opposite cell on a line from the opponent's last move and across the center of the board. Second-player draw strategies were also sent by Allan W. Dickinson, Richmond Heights, Missouri, and Michael Merritt, a student at Texas A. \\& M. College. These strategies apply to all even-order fields, and since no draws are possible on such fields higher than 6 , the strategy guarantees a win for the second player on all even-order boards of 8 or higher. Even on the order-6, a reflection strategy across a parallel bisector is sure to win, because the unique draw pattern does not have that type of symmetry.\n\nSymmetry play fails on odd-order fields because of the central cell. Since nothing is known about strategies on odd-order boards, the order-7 is the best field for actual play. It cannot end in a draw, and no one at present knows whether the first or second player wins if both sides play rationally.\n\nIn 1963 Walter W. Massie, a civil engineering student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, devised a Hip-playing program for the IBM 1620 digital computer, and wrote a term paper about it. The program allows the computer to play first or second on any square field of orders 4 through 10 . The computer takes a random cell if it moves first. On other plays, it follows a reflection strategy except when a reflected move forms a square, then it makes random choices until it finds a safe cell.\n\nOn all square fields of order \\(n\\), the number of different squares that can be formed by four cells is \\(\\left(n^{4}-n^{2}\\right) / 12\\). The derivation of this formula, as well as a formula for rectangular boards, is given in Harry Langman, Play Mathematics, Hafner, 1962, pages 36-37.\n\nAs far as I know, no studies have been made of comparable \"triangle-free\" colorings on triangular lattice fields."}
{"problem": "A Switching Puzzle}\n\nTHE EFFICIENT switching of railroad cars often poses frustrating problems in the field of operations research. The switching puzzle shown is one that has the merit of combining simplicity with surprising difficulty.\n\nThe tunnel is wide enough to accommodate the locomotive but not wide enough for either car. The problem is to use the locomotive for switching the positions of cars \\(\\mathrm{A}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{B}\\), then return the locomotive to its original spot. Each end of the locomotive can be used for pushing or pulling, and the two cars may, if desired, be coupled to each other.\n\nThe best solution is the one requiring the fewest operations. An \"operation\" is here defined as any movement of the locomotive between stops, assuming that it stops when it reverses direction, meets a car to push it or unhooks from a car it has been pulling. Movements of the two switches are not counted as operations.\n\nA convenient way to work on the puzzle is to place a penny, a dime and a nickel on the illustration and slide them along the tracks, remembering that only the coin representing the locomotive can pass through the tunnel. In the illustration, the cars were drawn in positions too close to the switches. While working on the problem, assume that both cars are far enough east along the track so that there is ample space between each car and switch to accommodate both the locomotive and the other car.\n\nNo \"flying switch\" maneuvers are permitted. For example, you are not permitted to turn the switch quickly just after the engine has pushed an unattached car past it, so that the car goes one way and the engine, without stopping, goes another way.", "solution": "The locomotive can switch the positions of cars A and B, and return to its former spot, in 16 operations:"}
{"problem": "Beer Signs on the Highway}\n\nSmith drove at a steady clip along the highway, his wife beside him. \"Have you noticed,\" he said, \"that those annoying signs for Flatz beer seem to be regularly spaced along the road? I wonder how far apart they are.\"\n\nMrs. Smith glanced at her wrist watch, then counted the number of Flatz beer signs they passed in one minute.\n\n\"What an odd coincidence!\" exclaimed Smith. \"When you multiply that number by ten, it exactly equals the speed of our car in miles per hour.\"\n\nAssuming that the car's speed is constant, that the signs are equally spaced and that Mrs. Smith's minute began and ended with the car midway between two signs, how far is it between one sign and the next?", "solution": "The curious thing about the problem of the Flatz beer signs is that it is not necessary to know the car's speed to determine the spacing of the signs. Let \\(x\\) be the number of signs passed in one minute. In an hour the car will pass \\(60 x\\) signs. The speed of the car, we are told, is \\(10 x\\) miles per hour. In \\(10 x\\) miles it will pass \\(60 x\\) signs, so in one mile it will pass \\(60 x / 10 x\\), or 6 , signs. The signs therefore are \\(1 / 6\\) mile, or 880 feet, apart."}
{"problem": "The Sliced Cube and the Sliced Doughnut}\n\nAN ENGINEER, noted for his ability to visualize three-dimensional structure, was having coffee and doughnuts. Before he dropped a sugar cube into his cup, he placed the cube on the table and thought: If I pass a horizontal plane through the cube's center, the cross section will of course be a square. If I pass it vertically through the center and four corners of the\ncube, the cross section will be an oblong rectangle. Now suppose I cut the cube this way with the plane. . . . To his surprise, his mental image of the cross section was a regular hexagon.\n\nHow was the slice made? If the cube's side is half an inch, what is the side of the hexagon?\n\nAfter dropping the cube into his coffee, the engineer turned his attention to a doughnut lying flat on a plate. \"If I pass a plane horizontally through the center,\" he said to himself, \"the cross section will be two concentric circles. If I pass the plane vertically through the center, the section will be two circles separated by the width of the hole. But if I turn the plane so. . . \" \" He whistled with astonishment. The section consisted of two perfect circles that intersected!\n\nHow was this slice made? If the doughnut is a perfect torus, three inches in outside diameter and with a hole one inch across, what are the diameters of the intersecting circles?", "solution": "A cube, cut in half by a plane that passes through the midpoints of six sides as shown, produces a cross section that is a regular hexagon. If the cube is half an inch on the side, the side of the hexagon is \\(\\sqrt{2 / 4}\\) inch.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-68.jpg?height=914&width=834&top_left_y=164&top_left_x=228)\n\nTo cut a torus so that the cross section consists of two intersecting circles, the plane must pass through the center and be tangent to the torus above and below, as shown in the second picture (next page). If the torus and hole have diameters of three inches and one inch, each circle of the section will clearly have a diameter of two inches.\n\nThis way of slicing, and the two ways described earlier, are the only ways to slice a doughnut so that the cross sections are circular.

{"problem": "Bisecting Yin and Yang}\n\nTwo mathematicians were dining at the Yin and Yang, a Chinese restaurant on West Third Street in Manhattan. They chatted about the symbol on the restaurant's menu, shown in the illustration.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-25.jpg?height=541&width=534&top_left_y=1276&top_left_x=356)\n\n\"I suppose it's one of the world's oldest religious symbols,\" one of them said. \"It would be hard to find a more attractive way to symbolize the great polarities of nature: good and evil, male and female, inflation and deflation, integration and differentiation.\"\n\n\"Isn't it also the symbol of the Northern Pacific Railway?\"\n\n\"Yes. I understand that one of the chief engineers of the railroad saw the emblem on a Korean flag at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893 and urged his company to adopt it. He said it symbolized the extremes of fire and water that drove the steam engine.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose it inspired the construction of the modern baseball?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised. By the way, did you know that there is an elegant method of drawing one straight line across the circle so that it exactly bisects the areas of the Yin and Yang?\"\n\nAssuming that the Yin and Yang are separated by two semicircles, show how each can be simultaneously bisected by the same straight line.", "solution": "The illustration shows how to construct a straight line that bisects both the Yin and the Yang. A simple proof is obtained by drawing the two broken semicircles. Circle K's diameter is half that of the monad; therefore its area is one-fourth that of the monad. Take region G from this circle, add \\(\\mathrm{H}\\), and the resulting region is also one-fourth the monad's area. It follows that area \\(G\\) equals area \\(H\\), and of course half of \\(G\\) must equal half of \\(H\\). The bisecting line takes half of \\(G\\) away from circle \\(K\\), but restores the same area (half of \\(H\\) ) to the circle, so the black area below the bisecting line must have the same area as circle K. The small circle's area is one-fourth the large circle's area, therefore the Yin is bisected. The same argument applies to the Yang.\n\nThe foregoing proof was given by Henry Dudeney in his answer to problem 158, Amusements in Mathematics (Thomas Nelson \\& Sons, 1917; Dover reprint, 1958). After it appeared in Scientific American, four readers (A. E. Decae, F. J. Hooven, Charles W. Trigg and B. H. K. Willoughby) sent the following alternative proof, which is much simpler. Draw a horizontal diameter of the small circle K. The semicircle below this line has an area that is clearly \\(1 / 8\\) that of the large circle. Above the diameter is a 45-degree sector of the large circle (bounded by the small circle's horizontal diameter and the diagonal line) which also is obviously \\(1 / 8\\) the area of the large circle. Together, the semicircle and sector have an area of \\(1 / 4\\) that of the large circle, therefore the diagonal line must bisect both Yin and Yang. For ways of bisecting the Yin and Yang with curved lines, the reader is referred to Dudeney's problem, citedabove, and Trigg's article, \"Bisection of Yin and of Yang,\" in Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 34, No. 2, NovemberDecember 1960, pages 107-108.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-70.jpg?height=541&width=540&top_left_y=1308&top_left_x=355)\n\nThe Yin-Yang symbol (called the T'ai-chi-t' \\(u\\) in China and the Tomoye in Japan) is usually drawn with a small spot of Yin inside the Yang and a small spot of Yang inside the Yin. This symbolizes the fact that the great dualities of life are seldom pure; each usually contains a bit of the other. There is an extensive Oriental literature on the symbol. Sam Loyd, who bases several puzzles on the figure (Sam Loyd's Cyclopedia of Puzzles, page 26), calls it the Great Monad. The term \"monad\" is repeated by Dudeney, and also used by Olin D. Wheeler in a booklet entitled Wonderland, published in 1901 by the Northern Pacific Railway. Wheeler's first chapter is devoted to a history of the trademark, and is filled with curious information and color reproductions from Oriental sources.\n\nFor more on the symbol, see Schuyler Cammann, \"The Magic Square of Three in Old Chinese Philosophy and Religion,\" History of Religions, Vol. 1, No. 1, Summer 1961, pages 37-80, my New Ambidextrous Universe (W.

John William Burgon, for example. His poems are so mediocre that no one reads them now, yet he wrote one of the most marvelous lines in English poetry : 'A rose-red city half as old as Time.'\"\n\nThe mathematician, who liked to annoy his friends with improvised brainteasers, thought for a moment or two, then raised his glass and recited:\n\n\"A rose-red city half as old as Time.\n\nOne billion years ago the city's age\n\nWas just two-fifths of what Time's age will be A billion years from now.

{"problem": "Tricky Track}\n\nThree high SCHOOLs-Washington, Lincoln and Rooseveltcompeted in a track meet. Each school entered one man, and one only, in each event. Susan, a student at Lincoln High, sat in the bleachers to cheer her boyfriend, the school's shot-put champion.\n\nWhen Susan returned home later in the day, her father asked how her school had done.\n\n\"We won the shot-put all right,\" she said, \"but Washington High won the track meet. They had a final score of 22 . We finished with 9. So did Roosevelt High.\"\n\n\"How were the events scored?\" her father asked.\n\n\"I don't remember exactly,\" Susan replied, \"but there was a certain number of points for the winner of each event, a smaller number for second place and a still smaller number for third place. The numbers were the same for all events.\" (By \"number\" Susan of course meant a positive integer.)\n\n\"How many events were there altogether?\"\n\n\"Gosh, I don't know, Dad. All I watched was the shot-put.\"\n\n\"Was there a high jump?\" asked Susan's brother.\n\nSusan nodded.\n\n\"Who won it?\"\n\nSusan didn't now.\n\nIncredible as it may seem, this last question can be answered with only the information given. Which school won the high jump?", "solution": "There is space only to suggest the procedure by which it can be shown that Washington High won the high jump event in the track meet involving three schools. Three different positive integers provide points for first, second and third place in each event. The integer for first place must be at least 3 . We know there are at least two events in the track meet, and that Lincoln High (which won the shot-put) had a final score of 9 , so the integer for first place cannot be more than 8. Can it be 8 ? No, because then only two events could take place and there is no way that Washington High could build up a total of 22 points. It cannot be 7 because this permits no more than three events, and three are still not sufficient to enable Washington High to reach a score of 22. Slightly more involved arguments eliminate 6,4 and 3 as the integer for first place. Only 5 remains as a possibility.\n\nIf 5 is the value for first place, there must be at least five events in the meet. (Fewer events are not sufficient to give Washington a total of 22, and more than five would raise Lincoln's total to more than 9.) Lincoln scored 5 for the shot-put, so its four other scores must be 1 . Washington can now reach 22 in only two ways: \\(4,5,5,5,3\\) or \\(2,5,5\\), 5,5 . The first is eliminated because it gives Roosevelt a score of 17 , and we know that this score is 9 . The remaining possibility gives Roosevelt a correct final tally, so we have the unique reconstruction of the scoring shown in the table,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-72.jpg?height=327&width=381&top_left_y=1517&top_left_x=419)\n\nWashington High won all events except the shot-put, consequently it must have won the high jump.\n\nMany readers sent shorter solutions than the one just given. Two readers (Mrs. Erlys Jedlicka, Saratoga, California, and Albert Zoch, a student at Illinois Institute of Technology) noticed that there was a short cut to the solution based on the assumption that the problem had a unique answer. Mrs. Jedlicka put it this way:\n\nDear Mr. Gardner:\n\nDid you know this problem can be solved without any calculation whatever? The necessary clue is in the last paragraph. The solution to the integer equations must indicate without ambiguity which school won the high jump. This can only be done if one school has won all the events, not counting the shot-put; otherwise the problem could not be solved with the information given, even after calculating the scoring and number of events. Since the school that won the shot-put was not the over-all winner, it is obvious that the over-all winner won the remaining events. Hence without calculation it can be said that Washington High won the high jump."}
{"problem": "Termite and 27 Cubes}\n\nImagine a large cube formed by gluing together 27 smaller wooden cubes of uniform size as shown. A termite starts at the center of the face of any one of the outside cubes and bores a path that takes him once through every cube. His movement is always parallel to a side of the large cube, never diagonal.\n\nIs it possible for the termite to bore through each of the 26 outside cubes once and only once, then finish his trip by entering the central cube for the first time? If possible, show how it can be done; if impossible, prove it.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-28.jpg?height=510&width=479&top_left_y=999&top_left_x=370)\n\nIt is assumed that the termite, once it has bored into a small cube, follows a path entirely within the large cube. Otherwise, it could crawl out on the surface of the large cube and move along the surface to a new spot of entry. If this were permitted, there would, of course, be no problem.", "solution": "It is not possible for the termite to pass once through the 26 outside cubes and end its journey in the center one. This is easily demonstrated by imagining that the cubes alternate in color like the cells of a three-dimensional checkerboard, or the sodium and chlorine atoms in the cubical crystal lattice of ordinary salt. The large cube will then consist of 13 cubes of one color and 14 of the other color. The termite's path is always through cubes that alternate in color along the way; therefore if the path is to include all 27 cubes, it must begin and end with a cube belonging to the set of 14 . The central cube, however, belongs to the \\(13 \\mathrm{set}\\); hence the desired path is impossible.\n\nThe problem can be generalized as follows: A cube of even order (an even number of cells on the side) has the same number of cells of one color as it has cells of the other color. There is no central cube, but complete paths may start on any cell and end on any cell of opposite color. A cube of odd order has one more cell of one color than the other, so a complete path must begin and end on the color that is used for the larger set. In odd-order cubes of orders \\(3,7,11,15,19 \\ldots\\) the central cell belongs to the smaller set, so it cannot be the end of any complete path. In odd-order cubes of \\(1,5,9,13,17 \\ldots\\) the central cell belongs to the larger set, so it can be the end of any path that starts on a cell of the same color. No closed path, going through every unit\ncube, is possible on any odd-order cube because of the extra cube of one color.\n\nMany two-dimensional puzzles can be solved quickly by similar \"parity checks.\" For example, it is not possible for a rook to start at one corner of a chessboard and follow a path that carries it once through every square and ends on the square at the diagonally opposite corner."}

The problem is to change their positions to those shown at the bottom of the illustration in the shortest possible number of moves.\n\nA move consists of placing the tips of the first and second fingers on any two touching coins, one of which must be a penny and the other a dime, then sliding the pair to another spot along the imaginary line shown in the illustration. The two coins in the pair must touch at all times. The coin at left in the pair must remain at left; the coin at right must remain at right.

Coins are numbered from left to right."}
{"problem": "Time the Toast}\n\nEVEN THE SIMPLEST of household tasks can present complicated problems in operational research. Consider the preparation of three slices of hot buttered toast. The toaster is the oldfashioned type, with hinged doors on its two sides. It holds two pieces of bread at once but toasts each of them on one side only. To toast both sides it is necessary to open the doors and reverse the slices.\n\nIt takes three seconds to put a slice of bread into the toaster, three seconds to take it out and three seconds to reverse a slice without removing it. Both hands are required for each of these operations, which means that it is not possible to put in, take out or turn two slices simultaneously. Nor is it possible to butter a slice while another slice is being put into the toaster, turned or taken out. The toasting time for one side of a piece of bread is thirty seconds. It takes twelve seconds to butter a slice.\n\nEach slice is buttered on one side only. No side may be buttered until it has been toasted. A slice toasted and buttered on one side may be returned to the toaster for toasting on its other side. The toaster is warmed up at the start. In how short a time can three slices of bread be toasted on both sides and buttered?", "solution": "I originally published a solution showing how the three slices of bread could be toasted in two minutes. Five readers surprised me by cutting the time to 111 seconds.

{"problem": "A Fixed-Point Theorem}\n\nONE morning, exactly at sunrise, a Buddhist monk began to climb a tall mountain. The narrow path, no more than a foot or two wide, spiraled around the mountain to a glittering temple at the summit.\n\nThe monk ascended the path at varying rates of speed, stopping many times along the way to rest and to eat the dried fruit he carried with him. He reached the temple shortly before sunset. After several days of fasting and meditation he began his journey back along the same path, starting at sunrise and again walking at variable speeds with many pauses along the way. His average speed descending was, of course, greater than his average climbing speed.\n\nProve that there is a spot along the path that the monk will occupy on both trips at precisely the same time of day.", "solution": "A man goes up a mountain one day, down it another day. Is there a spot along the path that he occupies at the same time of day on both trips? This problem was called to my attention by psychologist Ray Hyman, of the University of Oregon, who in turn found it in a monograph entitled \"On Problem-Solving,\" by the German Gestalt psychologist Karl Duncker. Duncker writes of being unable to solve it and of observing with satisfaction that others to whom he put the problem had the same difficulty. There are several ways to go about it, he continues, \"but probably none is . . . more drastically evident than the following. Let ascent and descent be divided between two persons on the same day. They must meet. Ergo. . . . With this, from an unclear dim condition not easily surveyable, the situation has suddenly been brought into full daylight.\""}
{"problem": "How Did Kant Set His Clock?}\n\nIT IS SAID that Immanuel Kant was a bachelor of such regular habits that the good people of K\u00f6nigsberg would adjust their clocks when they saw him stroll past certain landmarks.\n\nOne evening Kant was dismayed to discover that his clock had run down. Evidently his manservant, who had taken the day off, had forgotten to wind it. The great philosopher did not reset the hands because his watch was being repaired and he had no way of knowing the correct time. He walked to the home of his friend Schmidt, a merchant who lived a mile or so away, glancing at the clock in Schmidt's hallway as he entered the house.\n\nAfter visiting Schmidt for several hours Kant left and walked home along the route by which he came. As always, he walked with a slow, steady gait that had not varied in twenty years. He had no notion of how long this return trip took. (Schmidt had recently moved into the area and Kant had not yet timed himself on this walk.) Nevertheless, when Kant entered his house, he immediately set his clock correctly.\n\nHow did Kant know the correct time?", "solution": "Immanuel Kant calculated the exact time of his arrival home as follows. He had wound his clock before leaving, so a glance at its face told him the amount of time that had elapsed during his absence. From this he subtracted the length of time spent with Schmidt (having checked Schmidt's hallway clock when he arrived and again when he left). This gave him the total time spent in walking. Since he returned along the same route, at the same speed, he halved the total walking time to obtain the length of time it took him to walk home. This added to the time of his departure from Schmidt's house gave him the time of his arrival home."}
{"problem": "Playing Twenty Questions when Probability Values Are Known}\n\nIN THE well-known game Twenty Questions one person thinks of an object, such as the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia or Lawrence Welk's left little toe, and another person tries to guess the object by asking no more than twenty questions, each answerable by yes or no. The best questions are usually those that divide the set of possible objects into two subsets as nearly equal in number as possible. Thus if a person has chosen as his \"object\" a number from 1 through 9 , it can be guessed by this procedure in no more than four questions-possibly less. In\ntwenty questions one can guess any number from 1 through \\(2^{20}\\) (or \\(1,048,576\\) ).\n\nSuppose that each of the possible objects can be given a different value to represent the probability that it has been chosen. For example, assume that a deck of cards consists of one ace of spades, two deuces of spades, three threes, and on up to nine nines, making 45 spade cards in all. The deck is shuffled; someone draws a card. You are to guess it by asking yes-no questions. How can you minimize the number of questions that you will probably have to ask?", "solution": "The first step is to list in order the probability values for the nine cards: \\(1 / 45,2 / 45,3 / 45 \\ldots\\). The two lowest values are combined to form a new element: \\(1 / 45\\) plus \\(2 / 45\\) equals \\(3 / 45\\). In other words, the probability that the chosen card is either an ace or deuce is \\(3 / 45\\). There are now eight elements: the ace-deuce set, the three, the four, and so on up to nine. Again the two lowest probabilities are combined: the ace-deuce value of \\(3 / 45\\) and the \\(3 / 45\\) probability that the card is a three. This new element, consisting of aces, deuces and threes, has a probability value of \\(6 / 45\\). This is greater than the values for either the fours or fives, so when the two lowest values are combined again, we must pair the fours and fives to obtain an element with the value of \\(9 / 45\\). This procedure of pairing the lowest elements is continued until\nonly one element remains. It will have the probability value of \\(45 / 45\\), or 1 .\n\nThis chart shows how the elements are combined. The strategy for minimizing the number of questions is to take these pairings in reverse order. Thus the first question could be: Is the card in the set of fours, fives and nines? If not, you know it is in the other set so you ask next: Is it a seven or eight? And so on until the card is guessed.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-76.jpg?height=158&width=1092&top_left_y=566&top_left_x=71)\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{45}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{2}{45}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{3}{45}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{4}{45}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{5}{45}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{6}{45}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{7}{45}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{8}{45}\\)\n\n\\(\\frac{9}{45}\\)\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-76.jpg?height=270&width=410&top_left_y=783&top_left_x=124)\n\n\\(\\frac{12}{45}\\)\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-76.jpg?height=636&width=690&top_left_y=776&top_left_x=434)\n\nNote that if the card should be an ace or deuce it will take five questions to pinpoint it. A binary strategy, of simply dividing the elements as nearly as possible into halves for each question, will ensure that no more than four questions need be asked, and you might even guess the card in three. Nevertheless, the previously described procedure will give a slightly lower expected minimum number of questions in the long run; in fact, the lowest possible. In this case, the minimum number is three.\n\nThe minimum is computed as follows: Five questions are needed if the card is an ace. Five are also needed if the card is a deuce, but there are two deuces, making ten questions in all. Similarly, the three threes call for three times four, or 12, questions. The total number of questions for all 45 cards is 135 , or an average of three questions per card.\n\nThis strategy was first discovered by David A. Huffman, an electrical engineer at M.I.T., while he was a graduate student there. It is explained in his paper \"A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes,\" Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, Vol. 40, pages 1098-1101, September 1952. It was later rediscovered by Seth Zimmerman, who described it in his article on \"An Optimal Search Procedure,\" American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 66, pages 690-693, October 1959. A good nontechnical exposition of the procedure will be found in John R. Pierce, Symbols, Signals and Noise (Harper \\& Brothers, 1961), beginning on page 94.\n\nThe eminent mathematician Stanislaw Ulam, in his biography Adventures of a Mathematician (Scribner's, 1976, page 281), suggested adding the following rule to the Twenty Questions game. The person who answers is permitted one lie. What is the minimum number of questions required to determine a number between 1 and one million? What if he lies twice?\n\nThe general case is far from solved. If there are no lies, the answer is of course 20. If just one lies, 25 questions suffice. This was proved by Andrzej Pelc, in \"Solution of Ulam's Problem on Searching with a Lie,\" in Fournal of Combinatorial Theory (Series A), Vol. 44, pages 129-140, January 1987. The author also gives an algorithm for finding the minimum number of needed questions for identifying any number between 1 and \\(n\\). A different proof of the 25 minimum is given by Ivan Niven in \"Coding Theory Applied to a Problem of Ulam,\" Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 61, pages 275-281, December 1988.\n\nWhen two lies are allowed, the answer of 29 questions was established by Jurek Czyzowicz, Andrzej Pelc and Daniel Mundici in the Fournal of Combinatorial Theory (Series A), Vol. 49, pages 384-388, November 1988. In the same journal (Vol. 52, pages 62-76, September 1989), the same authors solved the more general case of two lies and any number between 1 and \\(2^{n}\\). Wojciech Guziki, ibid., Vol. 54, pages \\(1-19,1990\\), completely disposed of the two-lie case for any number between 1 and \\(n\\).\n\nHow about three lies? This has been answered only for numbers between 1 and one million. The solution is given by Alberto Negro and Matteo Sereno, in the same journal, Vol. 59, 1992. It is 33 questions, and that's no lie.\n\nThe four-lie case remains unsolved even for numbers in the 1 to one million range. Of course if one is allowed to lie every time, there is no way to guess the number. Ulam's problem is closely related to error-correcting coding theory. Ian Stewart summarized the latest results in \"How to Play Twenty Questions with a Liar,\" in New Scientist (October 17, 1992), and Barry Cipra did the same in \"All Theorems Great and Small,\" SIAM News (July 1992, page 28)."}

This checks the black king, but black is now free to capture the checking bishop with his rook.\n\nWhen this problem appeared in Scientific American, dozens of readers complained that the position shown is not a possible one because there are two white bishops on the same color squares. They forgot that a pawn on the last row can be exchanged for any piece, not just the queen. Either of the two missing white pawns could have been promoted to a second bishop.\n\nThere have been many games by masters in which pawns were promoted to knights. Promotions to bishops are admittedly rare, yet one can imagine situations in which it would be desirable. For instance, to avoid stalemating the opponent. Or white may see that he can use either a new queen or a new bishop in a subtle checkmate. If he calls for a queen, it will be taken by a black rook, in turn captured by a white knight. But if white calls for a bishop, black may be reluctant to trade a rook for bishop and so let the bishop remain."}
{"problem": "Find the Hexahedrons}\n\nA POLYHEDRON is a solid bounded by plane polygons known as the faces of the solid. The simplest polyhedron is the tetrahedron, consisting of four faces, each a triangle [left figure]. A tetrahedron can have an endless variety of shapes, but if we regard its network of edges as a topological invariant (that is, we may alter the length of any edge and the angles at which edges meet but we must preserve the structure of the network), then there is only one basic type of tetrahedron. It is not possible, in other words, for a tetrahedron to have sides that are anything but triangles.\n\nThe five-sided polyhedron has two basic varieties [middle and right figures]. One is represented by the Great Pyramid of Egypt (four triangles on a quadrilateral base). The other is represented by a tetrahedron with one corner sliced off; three of its faces are quadrilaterals, two are triangles.\n\nJohn McClellan, an artist in Woodstock, New York, asks this question: How many basic varieties of convex hexahedrons, or six-sided solids, are there altogether? (A solid is convex if each of its sides can be placed flat against a table top.) The cube is, of course, the most familiar example.\n\nIf you search for hexahedrons by chopping corners from simpler solids, you must be careful to avoid duplication. For example, the Great Pyramid, with its apex sliced off, has a skeleton that is topologically equivalent to that of the cube. Be careful also to avoid models that cannot exist without warped faces.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_31_9d64d31ab339da9ee4fag-33.jpg?height=508&width=1060&top_left_y=1322&top_left_x=78)", "solution": "The seven varieties of convex hexahedrons, with topologically distinct skeletons, are shown in the illustration (next page).

I considered a set $S$ with elements $a, b, c, d \\in S$, where $T = \\{a, b\\}$ and $U = \\{c, d\\}$. I calculated the products of various combinations of elements from $T$ and $U$: $ab \\in T$, $cd \\in U$, $ac \\notin T$, $bd \\notin U$.\n\nI pondered for a moment, trying to make sense of the problem. I reminded myself of the definition of a closed set under multiplication and the given conditions that the union of $T$ and $U$ is $S$. I thought about the properties of disjoint sets and how they might apply to this problem.\n\nI tried to prove that one of the subsets, say $T$, is closed under multiplication. I assumed that $T$ is closed under multiplication and proceeded to show that the product of any three elements in $T$ is also in $T$. However, I couldn't find a counterexample to disprove this assumption. I double-checked my calculations and even tried a few more examples, but nothing seemed to contradict the assumption.\n\nFeeling a bit stuck, I decided to take a break and think about the problem from a different angle. I reminded myself of various proof strategies, such as proof by contradiction, and considered how they might apply to this problem. However, I couldn't see a clear way to use these strategies to make progress.\n\nI sat back in my chair, feeling frustrated. I knew that I was missing something crucial, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I decided to take a break and come back to the problem later with a fresh perspective.

I calculated their products and found that they were all in $T$.\n\nFeeling confident, I thought I had proven that $T$ is closed under multiplication. However, I soon realized that I had made an error in my reasoning. I had only checked combinations of three elements where all elements were distinct.

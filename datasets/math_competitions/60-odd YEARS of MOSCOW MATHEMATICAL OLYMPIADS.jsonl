If it happened after the cell \\(A\\) went out then, first, the row and the column containing \\(A\\) had the unlighted cells \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) before, see Fig. 413, and, second, any unlighted cell connected (by a rook's path) with \\(A\\) had been previously connected with either \\(B\\) or \\(C\\), too; these cells were connected with each other via the fourth vertex of a \\(2 \\times 2\\) square. Hence, before \\(A\\) went out both conditions were satisfied contradicting the choice of \\(A\\).\n\nNow, let us prove by the induction on \\(k=m+n\\) that the number \\(p\\) of unlighted cells was \\(\\geq k-1\\). Then the inequality \\(p<k-1\\) implies precisely that the whole screen will not blacken out.\n\nOtherwise, for \\(m \\geq n\\) and \\(k>2\\) there would be a row with not more than 1 unlighted cell, \\(D\\), (or else \\(p \\geq 2 m \\geq k\\) ) connected with any unlighted cell via a cell \\(E\\) from the same column. Therefore, having thrown out the found row we get the screen of size \\((m-1) \\times n\\) satisfying both conditions and, therefore, the inequality\n\n\\[\np-1 \\geq(m-1)+n-1=k-2 \\Longrightarrow p \\geq k-1 \\text {. }\n\\]\n\nFinally, one should verify that for \\(k=2\\) the inequality \\(p \\geq 1=k-1\\) is satisfied which completes the proof.", "hint": null, "answer": null}

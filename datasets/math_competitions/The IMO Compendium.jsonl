{"problem": "C7 (NZL) Among a group of 120 people, some pairs are friends. A weak quartet is a set of four people containing exactly one pair of friends. What is the maximum possible number of weak quartets?", "solution": "For a graph \\(G\\) on 120 vertices (i.e., people at the party), write \\(q(G)\\) for the number of weak quartets in \\(G\\). Our solution will consist of three parts. First, we prove that some graph \\(G\\) with maximal \\(q(G)\\) breaks up as a disjoint union of complete graphs. This will follow if we show that any two adjacent vertices \\(x, y\\) have the same neighbors (apart from themselves). Let \\(G_{x}\\) be the graph obtained from \\(G\\) by \"copying\" \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) (i.e., for each \\(z \\neq x, y\\), we add the edge \\(z y\\) if \\(z x\\) is an edge, and delete \\(z y\\) if \\(z x\\) is not an edge). Similarly \\(G_{y}\\) is the graph obtained from \\(G\\) by copying \\(y\\) to \\(x\\). We claim that \\(2 q(G) \\leq q\\left(G_{x}\\right)+q\\left(G_{y}\\right)\\). Indeed, the number of weak quartets containing neither \\(x\\) nor \\(y\\) is the same in \\(G, G_{x}\\), and \\(G_{y}\\), while the number of those containing both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is not less in \\(G_{x}\\) and \\(G_{y}\\) than in \\(G\\). Also, the number containing exactly one of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(G_{x}\\) is at least twice the number in \\(G\\) containing \\(x\\) but not \\(y\\), while the number containing exactly one of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(G_{y}\\) is at least twice the number in \\(G\\) containing \\(y\\) but not \\(x\\). This justifies our claim by adding. It follows that for an extremal graph \\(G\\) we must have \\(q(G)=q\\left(G_{x}\\right)=q\\left(G_{y}\\right)\\). Repeating the copying operation pair by pair ( \\(y\\) to \\(x\\), then their common neighbor \\(z\\) to both \\(x, y\\), etc.) we eventually obtain an extremal graph consisting of disjoint complete graphs.\n\nSecond, suppose the complete graphs in \\(G\\) have sizes \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\).

Suppose that \\(P(x)=a_{2000} x^{2000}\\) \\(+a_{1999} x^{1999}+a_{0}\\) is an \\(n\\)-independent polynomial.

The game is nice if the permutation \\(P=t_{N} t_{N-1} \\ldots t_{1}\\) has no fixed point, and tiresome if \\(P\\) is the identity (denoted by \\(I\\) ). Recall that every permutation can be written as a composition of disjoint cycles.\n\nWe claim that there exists a nice game if and only if \\(n \\neq 3\\).\n\nFor \\(n=2, P_{2}=t_{1}=(1,2)\\) is obviously nice. For \\(n=3\\) each game has the form \\(P=(b, c)(a, c)(a, b)=(a, c)\\) for an appropriate notation of the players, which cannot be nice. Now for \\(n \\geq 4\\) we define\n\\(P_{n}=(1,2)(1,3)(2,3) \\cdots(1, n)(2, n) \\cdots(n-1, n)\\). We obtain inductively that \\(P_{n}=P_{n-1}(1, n, n-1, \\ldots, 2)=(1, n)(2, n-1) \\cdots(i, n+1-i) \\cdots\\) is nice for all even \\(n\\).\n\nAlso, if \\(n=2 k+1\\) is odd, then \\(Q_{n}=P_{n-1}(1, n)(2, n) \\cdots(k, n)(n-1, n)(n-\\) \\(2, n) \\cdots(k+1, n)\\) maps \\(i\\) to \\(n+1-i\\) for \\(i \\leq k\\), to \\(n-1-i\\) for \\(k+1 \\leq\\) \\(i \\leq 2 k-1\\), and to \\(3 k+1-i\\) if \\(i \\in\\{2 k, 2 k+1\\}\\). Hence \\(Q_{n}\\) is nice. This justifies our claim.\n\nNow we prove that a tiresome game exists if and only if \\(n \\equiv 0,1(\\bmod 4)\\). Evidently every transposition changes the sign of the permutation. Thus the sign of \\(P\\) is \\((-1)^{\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)}\\) and for \\(P\\) to be the identity we must have 2 | \\(\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right) \\Rightarrow n \\equiv 0,1(\\bmod 4)\\).\n\nLet us now construct tiresome games for the allowed \\(n\\).

To show that, permuting the \\(a_{i}\\) 's, we can find \\(n-1\\) different sequences, we use the following\n\nLemma. Let \\(A\\) be a \\(k \\times n(k \\leq n-2)\\) matrix of zeros and ones, whose every row contains at least one 0 and at least two 1's. Then it is possible to permute columns of \\(A\\) is such a way that in any row 1 's do not form a block.\n\nProof. We will use the induction on \\(k\\). The case \\(k=1\\) and arbitrary \\(n \\geq 3\\) is trivial. Suppose that \\(k \\geq 2\\) and that for \\(k-1\\) and any \\(n \\geq k+1\\) the lemma is true. Consider a \\(k \\times n\\) matrix \\(A, n \\geq k+2\\). We mark an element \\(a_{i j}\\) if either it is the only zero in the \\(i\\)-th row, or one of the 1 's in the row if it contains exactly two 1 's. Since \\(n \\geq 4\\), every row contains at most two marked elements, which adds up to at most \\(2 k<2 n\\) marked elements in total. It follows that there is a column with at most one marked element. Assume w.l.o.g. that it is the first column and that \\(a_{1 j}\\) isn't marked for \\(j>1\\). The matrix \\(B\\), obtained by omitting the first row and first column from \\(A\\), satisfies the conditions of the lemma. Therefore, we can permute columns of \\(B\\) and get the required form. Considered as a permutation of column of \\(A\\), this permutation may leave a block of 1 's only in the first row of \\(A\\). In the case that it is so, if \\(a_{11}=1\\) we put the first column in the last place, otherwise we put it between any two columns having 1 's in the first row. The obtained matrix has the required property.\n\nSuppose now that we have got \\(k\\) different nontrivial good sequences \\(e_{1}^{i}, \\ldots, e_{n}^{i}, i=1, \\ldots, k\\), and that \\(k \\leq n-2\\). The matrix \\(A=\\left(e_{j}^{i}\\right)\\)\nfulfils the conditions of Lemma, hence there is a permutation \\(\\sigma\\) from Lemma. Now among the sums \\(s_{0}=0, s_{1}=a_{\\sigma(1)}, s_{2}=a_{\\sigma(1)}+a_{\\sigma(2)}\\), \\(\\ldots, s_{n}=a_{\\sigma(1)}+\\cdots+a_{\\sigma(n)}\\), two give the same remainder modulo \\(n\\). Let \\(s_{p} \\equiv s_{q}(\\bmod n), p<q\\). Then \\(n \\mid s_{q}-s_{p}=a_{\\sigma(p+1)}+\\cdots+a_{\\sigma(q)}\\), and this yields a good sequence \\(e_{1}, \\ldots, e_{n}\\) with \\(e_{\\sigma(p+1)}=\\cdots=e_{\\sigma(q)}=1\\) and other \\(e\\) 's equal to zero. Since from the construction we see that none of the sequences \\(e_{\\sigma(j)^{i}}\\) has all 1's in a block, in this way we have got a new nontrivial good sequence, and we can continue this procedure until there are \\(n-1\\) sequences. Together with the trivial \\(0, \\ldots, 0\\) sequence, we have found \\(n\\) good sequences."}

Such an element must exist, since the diagonal can contain at most \\(n\\) different numbers. Let us call the union of the \\(i\\) th row and the \\(i\\) th column the \\(i\\) th cross. There are \\(n\\) crosses, and each of them contains exactly one \\(x\\). On the other hand, each entry \\(x\\) of \\(A\\) is contained in exactly two crosses. Hence \\(n\\) must be even. However, 1997 is an odd number; hence no coveralls matrix exists for \\(n=1997\\).\n\n(b) For \\(n=2, A_{2}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\) is a coveralls matrix. For \\(n=4\\), one such matrix is, for example,\n\n\\[\nA_{4}=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}\n1 & 2 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n3 & 1 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n4 & 6 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n7 & 4 & 3 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\nThis construction can be generalized. Suppose that we are given an \\(n \\times n\\) coveralls matrix \\(A_{n}\\). Let \\(B_{n}\\) be the matrix obtained from \\(A_{n}\\) by adding \\(2 n\\) to each entry, and \\(C_{n}\\) the matrix obtained from \\(B_{n}\\) by replacing each diagonal entry (equal to \\(2 n+1\\) by induction) with \\(2 n\\). Then the matrix\n\n\\[\nA_{2 n}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\nA_{n} & B_{n} \\\\\nC_{n} & A_{n}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\nis coveralls. To show this, suppose that \\(i \\leq n\\) (the case \\(i>n\\) is similar). The \\(i\\) th cross is composed of the \\(i\\) th cross of \\(A_{n}\\), the \\(i\\) th row of \\(B_{n}\\), and the \\(i\\) th column of \\(C_{n}\\). The \\(i\\) th cross of \\(A_{i}\\) covers \\(1,2, \\ldots, 2 n-1\\). The \\(i\\) th row of \\(B_{n}\\) covers all numbers of the form \\(2 n+j\\), where \\(j\\) is covered by the \\(i\\) th row of \\(A_{n}\\) (including \\(j=1\\) ). Similarly, the \\(i\\) th column of \\(C_{n}\\) covers \\(2 n\\) and all numbers of the form \\(2 n+k\\), where \\(k>1\\) is covered by the \\(i\\) th column of \\(A_{n}\\). Thus we see that all numbers are accounted for in the \\(i\\) th cross of \\(A_{2 n}\\), and hence \\(A_{2 n}\\) is a desired coveralls matrix. It follows that we can find a coveralls matrix whenever \\(n\\) is a power of 2.\n\nSecond solution for part \\(b\\). We construct a coveralls matrix explicitly for \\(n=2^{k}\\). We consider the coordinates/cells of the matrix elements modulo \\(n\\) throughout the solution. We define the \\(i\\)-diagonal \\((0 \\leq i<\\) \\(n\\) ) to be the set of cells of the form \\((j, j+i)\\), for all \\(j\\). We note that each cross contains exactly one cell from the 0-diagonal (the main diagonal) and two cells from each \\(i\\)-diagonal. For two cells within an \\(i\\) diagonal, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we define \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be related if there exists a cross containing both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Evidently, for every cell \\(x\\) not on the 0 -diagonal there are exactly two other cells related to it. The relation thus breaks up each \\(i\\)-diagonal \\((i>0)\\) into cycles of length larger than 1 . Due to the diagonal translational symmetry (modulo \\(n\\) ), all the cycles within a given \\(i\\)-diagonal must be of equal length and thus of an even length, since \\(n=2^{k}\\).\n\nThe construction of a coveralls matrix is now obvious. We select a number, say 1 , to place on all the cells of the 0-diagonal. We pair up the remaining numbers and assign each pair to an \\(i\\)-diagonal, say \\((2 i, 2 i+1)\\). Going along each cycle within the \\(i\\)-diagonal we alternately assign values of \\(2 i\\) and \\(2 i+1\\). Since the cycle has an even length, a cell will be related only to a cell of a different number, and hence each cross will contain both \\(2 i\\) and \\(2 i+1\\)."}

From \\(\\angle X Z Y=90^{\\circ}\\) follows \\(\\overrightarrow{Z X} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{Z Y}=(\\overrightarrow{I X}-\\overrightarrow{I Z}) \\cdot(\\overrightarrow{I Y}-\\overrightarrow{I Z})=0\\).\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\overrightarrow{M P}^{2} & =(\\overrightarrow{M I}+\\overrightarrow{I P})^{2}=\\frac{1}{4}(-\\overrightarrow{I Z}+\\overrightarrow{I X}+\\overrightarrow{I Y})^{2} \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{4}\\left(I X^{2}+I Y^{2}-I Z^{2}+2(\\overrightarrow{I X}-\\overrightarrow{I Z}) \\cdot(\\overrightarrow{I Y}-\\overrightarrow{I Z})\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{1}{2} r^{2}-\\frac{1}{4} I Z^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nLemma 3. Using notation as in Lemma 1, if \\(A B C D\\) is cyclic, \\(P R\\) is perpendicular to \\(Q S\\).\n\nProof. Consider the inversion in \\(C(I, r)\\), mapping \\(A\\) to \\(A^{\\prime}\\) etc. \\((P, Q, R, S\\) are fixed). As is easily seen, \\(A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}, D^{\\prime}\\) will lie at the midpoints of \\(P Q, Q R, R S, S P\\), respectively. \\(A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}\\) is a parallelogram, but also cyclic, since inversion preserves circles; thus it must be a rectangle, and so \\(P R \\perp Q S\\).\n\nNow we return to the main result. Let \\(I\\) and \\(O\\) be the incenter and circumcenter, \\(Z\\) the intersection of the diagonals, and \\(P, Q, R, S, A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}, D^{\\prime}\\) points as defined in Lemmas 1 and 3 . From Lemma 3, the chords \\(P Q, Q R, R S, S P\\) subtend \\(90^{\\circ}\\) at \\(Z\\). Therefore by Lemma 2 the points \\(A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}, D^{\\prime}\\) lie on a circle whose center is the midpoint \\(Y\\) of \\(I Z\\). Since this circle is the image of the circle \\(A B C D\\) under the considered inversion (centered at \\(I\\) ), it follows that \\(I, O, Y\\) are collinear, and hence so are \\(I, O, Z\\).\n\nRemark. This is the famous Newton's theorem for bicentric quadrilaterals."}

Having this done for every such line \\(l\\), we obtain a set of segments forming certain polygonal lines. If one of these polygonal lines is closed, then it must have an even number of vertices. Thus, we can color the vertices on each of the polygonal lines alternately (a point not lying on any of the polygonal lines may be colored arbitrarily).

Otherwise, edges connecting \\(c_{2}, c_{3}, c_{4}\\) are all of the opposite color, let us call it blue, and hence in all cases we have a monochromatic triangle.\n\nLemma 2. Given a complete graph on five points whose edges are colored two colors there exists a monochromatic triangle or a monochromatic cycle of length five.\n\nProof. Let us denote the vertices by \\(c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, c_{4}, c_{5}\\). Assume that out of a point \\(c_{i}\\) three vertices are of the same color. We can then proceed as in Lemma 1 to obtain a monochromatic triangle. Otherwise, each\npoint is connected to other points with exactly two red and two blue vertices. Hence, we obtain monochromatic cycles starting from a single point and moving along the edges of the same color. Since each cycle must be of length at least three (i.e., we cannot have more than one cycle of one color), it follows that for both red and blue we must have one cycle of length five of that color.\n\nWe now apply the lemmas. Let us denote the vertices by \\(c_{1}, c_{2}, \\ldots, c_{10}\\). We apply Lemma 1 to vertices \\(c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{6}\\) to obtain a monochromatic triangle. Out of the seven remaining vertices we select 6 and again apply Lemma 1 to obtain another monochromatic triangle. If they are of the same color, we are done. Otherwise, out of the nine edges connecting the two triangles of opposite color at least 5 are of the same color, we can assume blue w.l.o.g., and hence a vertex of a red triangle must contain at least two blue edges whose endpoints are connected with a blue edge. Hence there exist two triangles of different colors joined at a vertex. These take up five points.

This will imply that \\(d\\) is odd (for even \\(d, a+1=b^{d}+1\\) cannot be divisible by 4 ), and consequently \\(b+1\\), as a divisor of \\(a+1\\), is also a power of 2 . But before that, we need the following important lemma (Theorem 2.126).\n\nLemma. Let \\(a, k\\) be positive integers and \\(p\\) an odd prime. If \\(\\alpha \\geq 1\\) and \\(\\beta \\geq 0\\) are such that \\(p^{\\alpha} \\| a-1\\) and \\(p^{\\beta} \\| k\\), then \\(p^{\\alpha+\\beta} \\| a^{k}-1\\).\n\nProof. We use induction on \\(\\beta\\). If \\(\\beta=0\\), then \\(\\frac{a^{k}-1}{a-1}=a^{k-1}+\\cdots+a+1 \\equiv k\\) \\((\\bmod p)(\\) because \\(a \\equiv 1)\\), and it is not divisible by \\(p\\).\n\nSuppose that the lemma is true for some \\(\\beta \\geq 0\\), and let \\(k=p^{\\beta+1} t\\) where \\(p \\nmid t\\). By the induction hypothesis, \\(a^{k / p}=a^{p^{\\beta} t}=m p^{\\alpha+\\beta}+1\\) for some \\(m\\) not divisible by \\(p\\). Furthermore,\n\n\\[\na^{k}-1=\\left(m p^{\\alpha+\\beta}+1\\right)^{p}-1=\\left(m p^{\\alpha+\\beta}\\right)^{p}+\\cdots+\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\np \\\\\n2\n\\end{array}\\right)\\left(m p^{\\alpha+\\beta}\\right)^{2}+m p^{\\alpha+\\beta+1}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(p \\left\\lvert\\,\\left(\\begin{array}{l}p \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{p(p-1)}{2}\\right.\\), all summands except for the last one are divisible by \\(p^{\\alpha+\\beta+2}\\). Hence \\(p^{\\alpha+\\beta+1} \\| a^{k}-1\\), completing the induction. Now let \\(a^{k}-1 \\sim a-1\\) for some \\(a, k>1\\). Suppose that \\(p\\) is an odd prime divisor of \\(k\\), with \\(p^{\\beta} \\| k\\). Then putting \\(X=a^{p^{\\beta}-1}+\\cdots+a+1\\) we also have \\((a-1) X=a^{p^{\\beta}}-1 \\sim a-1\\); hence each prime divisor \\(q\\) of \\(X\\) must also divide \\(a-1\\). But then \\(a^{i} \\equiv 1(\\bmod q)\\) for each \\(i \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}\\), which gives us \\(X \\equiv p^{\\beta}(\\bmod q)\\). Therefore \\(q \\mid p^{\\beta}\\), i.e., \\(q=p\\); hence \\(X\\) is a power of \\(p\\).\n\nOn the other hand, since \\(p \\mid a-1\\), we put \\(p^{\\alpha} \\| a-1\\). From the lemma we obtain \\(p^{\\alpha+\\beta} \\| a^{p^{\\beta}}-1\\), and deduce that \\(p^{\\beta} \\| X\\). But \\(X\\) has no prime divisors other than \\(p\\), so we must have \\(X=p^{\\beta}\\). This is clearly impossible, because \\(X>p^{\\beta}\\) for \\(a>1\\). Thus our assumption that \\(k\\) has an odd prime divisor leads to a contradiction: in other words, \\(k\\) must be a power of 2 . Now \\(a^{k}-1 \\sim a-1\\) implies \\(a-1 \\sim a^{2}-1=(a-1)(a+1)\\), and thus every prime divisor \\(q\\) of \\(a+1\\) must also divide \\(a-1\\). Consequently \\(q=2\\), so it follows that \\(a+1\\) is a power of 2 . As we explained above, this gives that \\(b+1\\) is also a power of 2 .\n\nRemark. In fact, one can continue and show that \\(k\\) must be equal to 2 . It is not possible for \\(a^{4}-1 \\sim a^{2}-1\\) to hold. Similarly, we must have \\(d=1\\). Therefore all possible triples \\((b, m, n)\\) with \\(m>n\\) are \\(\\left(2^{s}-1,2,1\\right)\\)."}

Let \\(G\\) be the centroid of \\(S\\). From \\(r_{P Q}(S)=S\\) it follows that \\(r_{P Q}(G)=G\\). Hence \\(G\\) belongs to the perpendicular bisector of \\(P Q\\) and thus \\(G P=G Q\\). Consequently the whole of \\(S\\) lies on a sphere \\(\\Sigma\\) centered at \\(G\\). We note the following two cases:\n\n(a) \\(S\\) is a subset of a plane \\(\\pi\\). In this case \\(S\\) is included in a circle \\(k, G\\) being its center. Hence its \\(n\\) points form a convex polygon \\(A_{1} A_{2} \\ldots A_{n}\\). When applying \\(r_{A_{i} A_{i+2}}\\) for some \\(0<i<n-1\\) the point \\(A_{i+1}\\) transforms into some point of \\(S\\) lying on the same side of \\(A_{i} A_{i+1}\\), which has to be \\(A_{i+1}\\) itself. It thus follows that \\(A_{i} A_{i+1}=A_{i+1} A_{i+2}\\) for all \\(0<i<n-1\\) and hence \\(A_{1} A_{2} \\ldots A_{n}\\) is a regular \\(n\\)-gon.\n\n(b) The points in \\(S\\) are not coplanar. It follows that \\(S\\) is a polyhedron \\(P\\) inscribed in a sphere \\(\\Sigma\\) centered at \\(G\\). By applying the previous case to the faces of the polyhedron, it follows that all faces are regular \\(n\\)-gons.\n\nLet us take an arbitrary vertex \\(V\\) and let \\(V V_{1}, V V_{2}\\) and \\(V V_{3}\\) be three consecutive edges stemming from \\(V\\left(V, V_{1}, V_{2}\\right.\\), and \\(V_{3}\\) defining two adjacent faces of \\(P\\) ). We now look at \\(r_{V_{1} V_{3}}\\). Since this transformation leaves the half-planes \\(\\left[V_{1} V_{3}, V_{2}\\right.\\) and \\(\\left[V_{1} V_{3}, V\\right.\\) invariant and since \\(V_{2}\\) and \\(V\\) are the only points of \\(P\\) on the respective half-planes, it follows that \\(r_{V_{1} V_{3}}\\) leaves \\(V\\) and \\(V_{2}\\) invariant. This transform also swaps \\(V_{1}\\) and \\(V_{3}\\). Hence, the face determined by \\(V V_{1} V_{2}\\) is transformed by \\(r_{V_{1} V_{3}}\\) into the face \\(V V_{3} V_{2}\\), and thus the two faces sharing \\(V V_{2}\\) are congruent. We conclude that all faces are congruent and similarly that vertices are endpoints of the same number of edges; hence \\(P\\) is a regular polyhedron.\n\nFinally, we have to rule out \\(S\\) being vertices of a cube, a dodecahedron, or an icosahedron. In all of these cases if we select two diametrically\nopposite points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), then \\(S \\backslash\\{P, Q\\}\\) is not symmetric with respect to the bisector of \\(P Q\\), which prevents \\(r_{P Q}\\) from being an invariant transformation of \\(S\\).\n\nIt thus follows that the only viable finite completely symmetric sets are vertices of regular \\(n\\)-gons, the tetrahedron, and the octahedron. It is not explicitly asked for, but it is easy to verify that all of these are indeed completely symmetric.\n\nRemark. On the IMO, a simpler version of this problem was adopted, adding the condition that \\(S\\) belongs to a plane and thus eliminating the need for the second case altogether."}

Hence \\(\\epsilon, \\iota\\), and \\(\\phi\\) all pass through \\(S\\) and are perpendicular to the plane \\(A B C\\), and consequently all share the line \\(l\\) through \\(S\\) perpendicular to \\(A B C\\).\n\nSince \\(l=\\epsilon \\cap \\iota\\), the point \\(O\\) will be situated on \\(l\\), and hence \\(\\phi\\) will also contain \\(O\\). This completes our proof of the lemma.\n\nLet \\(A H=A E=x, B E=B F=y, C F=C G=z\\), and \\(D G=D H=w\\). If the sphere is also tangent to \\(A C\\) at some point \\(I\\), then \\(A I=x\\) and \\(I C=z\\).

Further, using that \\(A B=x+y, B C=y+z, \\cos \\beta=1-t^{2} / 2 y^{2}\\), we obtain\n\n\\[\nA C^{2}=A B^{2}+B C^{2}-2 A B \\cdot B C \\cos \\beta=(x-z)^{2}+t^{2}\\left(\\frac{x}{y}+1\\right)\\left(\\frac{z}{y}+1\\right) .\n\\]\n\nAnalogously, from the triangle \\(A D C\\) we get \\(A C^{2}=(x-z)^{2}+t^{2}(x / w+\\) \\(1)(z / w+1)\\), which gives \\((x / y+1)(z / y+1)=(x / w+1)(z / w+1)\\).

Consider the Cartesian system in which points \\(O, E, F, G, H\\) respectively have coordinates \\((0,0,0),(-1,-1, a),(1,-1, a),(1,1, a),(-1,1, a)\\).

Therefore the \\(y\\)-coordinate of \\(A\\) is zero; analogously the \\(x\\)-coordinates of \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) and the \\(y\\)-coordinate of \\(C\\) are 0 . Let \\(A\\) have coordinates \\(\\left(x_{0}, 0, z_{1}\\right)\\) : then \\(\\overrightarrow{E A}\\left(x_{0}+1,1, z_{1}-a\\right) \\perp \\overrightarrow{E O}(1,1,-a)\\), i.e., \\(\\overrightarrow{E A} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{E O}=x_{0}+2+a\\left(a-z_{1}\\right)=0\\). Similarly, for \\(B\\left(0, y_{0}, z_{2}\\right)\\) we have \\(y_{0}+2+a\\left(a-z_{2}\\right)=0\\). This gives us\n\n\\[\nz_{1}=\\frac{x_{0}+a^{2}+2}{a}, \\quad z_{2}=\\frac{y_{0}+a^{2}+2}{a} .\n\\]\n\nWe haven't used yet that \\(A\\left(x_{0}, 0, z_{1}\\right), E(-1,-1, a)\\) and \\(B\\left(0, y_{0}, z_{2}\\right)\\) are collinear, so let \\(A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, E^{\\prime}\\) be the feet of perpendiculars from \\(A, B, E\\) to the plane \\(x y\\). The line \\(A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}\\), given by \\(y_{0} x+x_{0} y=x_{0} y_{0}, z=0\\), contains the point \\(E^{\\prime}(-1,-1,0)\\), from which we obtain\n\n\\[\n\\left(x_{0}+1\\right)\\left(y_{0}+1\\right)=1 \\text {. }\n\\]\n\nIn the same way, from the points \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) we get relations similar to (1) and (2) and conclude that \\(C\\) has the coordinates \\(C\\left(-x_{0}, 0, z_{1}\\right)\\). Similarly we get \\(D\\left(0,-y_{0}, z_{2}\\right)\\). The condition that \\(A C\\) is tangent to the sphere \\(\\sigma(O, O E)\\) is equivalent to \\(z_{1}=\\sqrt{a^{2}+2}\\), i.e., to \\(x_{0}=a \\sqrt{a^{2}+2}-\\left(a^{2}+2\\right)\\). But then (2) implies that \\(y_{0}=-a \\sqrt{a^{2}+2}-\\left(a^{2}+2\\right)\\) and \\(z_{2}=-\\sqrt{a^{2}+2}\\), which means that the sphere \\(\\sigma\\) is tangent to \\(B D\\) as well. This finishes the proof."}

Denote by \\(M_{k}(k=1,2, \\ldots, p)\\) the family of \\(p\\)-element multisets with \\(k\\) distinct elements from \\(\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2 p\\}\\), exactly one of which appears more than once, that have sum of elements divisible by \\(p\\). It is clear that every subset from \\(C_{k}, k<p\\), can be complemented to a multiset from \\(M_{k} \\cup M_{k+1}\\) in exactly two ways, since the equation \\((p-k) a \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)\\) has exactly two solutions in \\(\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2 p\\}\\). On the other hand, every multiset from \\(M_{k}\\) can be obtained by completing exactly one subset from \\(C_{k}\\). Additionally, a multiset from \\(M_{k}\\) can be obtained from exactly one subset from \\(C_{k-1}\\) if \\(k<p\\), and from exactly \\(p\\) subsets from \\(C_{k-1}\\) if \\(k=p\\). Therefore \\(\\left|M_{k}\\right|+\\left|M_{k+1}\\right|=2\\left|C_{k}\\right|=2\\left(\\begin{array}{c}2 p \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)\\) for \\(k=1,2, \\ldots, p-2\\), and \\(\\left|M_{p-1}\\right|+p\\left|M_{p}\\right|=2\\left|C_{p-1}\\right|=2\\left(\\begin{array}{c}2 p \\\\ p-1\\end{array}\\right)\\). Since \\(M_{1}=2 p\\), it is not difficult to show using recursion that \\(\\left|M_{p}\\right|=\\frac{1}{p}\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}2 p \\\\ p\\end{array}\\right)-2\\right)+2\\).\n\nThird solution. Let \\(\\omega=\\cos \\frac{2 \\pi}{p}+i \\sin \\frac{2 \\pi}{p}\\). We have \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{2 p}\\left(x-\\omega^{i}\\right)=\\) \\(\\left(x^{p}-1\\right)^{2}=x^{2 p}-2 x^{p}+1\\); hence comparing the coefficients at \\(x^{p}\\), we obtain \\(\\sum \\omega^{i_{1}+\\cdots+i_{p}}=\\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} a_{i} \\omega^{i}=2\\), where the first sum runs over all \\(p\\)-subsets \\(\\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{p}\\right\\}\\) of \\(\\{1, \\ldots, 2 p\\}\\), and \\(a_{i}\\) is the number of such subsets for which \\(i_{1}+\\cdots+i_{p} \\equiv i(\\bmod p)\\). Setting \\(q(x)=-2+\\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} a_{i} x^{i}\\), we obtain \\(q\\left(\\omega^{j}\\right)=0\\) for \\(j=1,2, \\ldots, p-1\\). Hence \\(1+x+\\cdots+x^{p-1} \\mid q(x)\\), and since \\(\\operatorname{deg} q=p-1\\), we have \\(q(x)=-2+\\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} a_{i} x^{i}=c\\left(1+x+\\cdots+x^{p-1}\\right)\\) for some constant \\(c\\). Thus \\(a_{0}-2=a_{1}=\\cdots=a_{p-1}\\), which together with \\(a_{0}+\\cdots+a_{p-1}=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}2 p \\\\ p\\end{array}\\right)\\) yields \\(a_{0}=\\frac{1}{p}\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}2 p \\\\ p\\end{array}\\right)-2\\right)+2\\)."}

He puts them into three boxes, a red one, a white one, and a blue one, so that each box contains at least one card. A member of the audience draws two cards from two different boxes and announces the sum of numbers on those cards. Given this information, the magician locates the box from which no card has been drawn. How many ways are there to put the cards in the three boxes so that the trick works?", "solution": "In order for the trick to work, whenever \\(x+y=z+t\\) and the cards \\(x, y\\) are placed in different boxes, either \\(z, t\\) are in these boxes as well or they are both in the remaining box.\n\nCase 1. The cards \\(i, i+1, i+2\\) are in different boxes for some \\(i\\). Since \\(i+(i+3)=(i+1)+(i+2)\\), the cards \\(i\\) and \\(i+3\\) must be in the same box; moreover, \\(i-1\\) must be in the same box as \\(i+2\\), etc. Hence the cards \\(1,4,7, \\ldots, 100\\) are placed in one box, the cards \\(2,5, \\ldots, 98\\) are in the second, while \\(3,6, \\ldots, 99\\) are in the third box. The number of different arrangements of the cards is 6 in this case.\n\nCase 2. No three successive cards are all placed in different boxes. Suppose that 1 is in the blue box, and denote by \\(w\\) and \\(r\\) the smallest numbers on cards lying in the white and red boxes; assume w.l.o.g. that \\(w<r\\). The card \\(w+1\\) is obviously not red, from which it follows that \\(r>\\) \\(w+1\\). Now suppose that \\(r<100\\). Since \\(w+r=(w-1)+(r+1), r+1\\) must be in the blue box. But then \\((r+1)+w=r+(w+1)\\) implies that \\(w+1\\) must be red, which is a contradiction. Hence the red box contains only the card 100 . Since \\(99+w=100+(w-1)\\), we deduce that the card 99 is in the white box. Moreover, if any of the cards \\(k\\), \\(2 \\leq k \\leq 99\\), were in the blue box, then since \\(k+99=(k-1)+100\\), the card \\(k-1\\) should be in the red box, which is impossible. Hence the blue box contains only the card 1 , whereas the cards \\(2,3, \\ldots, 99\\) are all in the white box.\n\nIn general, one box contains 1 , another box only 100, while the remaining contains all the other cards.

This completes the proof.\n\nSecond solution. The given recurrence formula resembles that of binomial coefficients, so it is natural to search for an explicit formula of the form \\(c(n, k)=\\frac{F(n)}{F(k) F(n-k)}\\), where \\(F(m)=f(1) f(2) \\cdots f(m)(\\) with \\(F(0)=1)\\) and \\(f\\) is a certain function from the natural numbers to the real numbers. If there is such an \\(f\\), then \\(c(n, k)=c(n, n-k)\\) follows immediately.\n\nAfter substitution of the above relation, the recurrence equivalently reduces to \\(f(n+1)=2^{k} f(n-k+1)+f(k)\\). It is easy to see that \\(f(m)=2^{m}-1\\) satisfies this relation.\n\nRemark. If we introduce the polynomial \\(P_{n}(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{n} c(n, k) x^{k}\\), the recurrence relation gives \\(P_{0}(x)=1\\) and \\(P_{n+1}(x)=x P_{n}(x)+P_{n}(2 x)\\). As a consequence of the problem, all polynomials in this sequence are symmetric, i.e., \\(P_{n}(x)=x^{n} P_{n}\\left(x^{-1}\\right)\\)."}

We group the set of lengths of vectors 3,7,.., 3979 into 199 sets of five consecutive elements of the set. We place each group of lengths on directions belonging to the same group of directions, thus constructing five vectors. We use that \\(\\overrightarrow{O C_{1}}+\\cdots+\\overrightarrow{O C_{n}}=0\\) where \\(O\\) is the center of a regular \\(n\\)-gon \\(C_{1} \\ldots C_{n}\\). In other words, vectors of equal lengths along directions that form a regular \\(n\\)-gon cancel each other out. Such are the groups of five directions. Hence, we can assume for each group of five lengths for its lengths to be \\(\\{0,4,8,12,16\\}\\). We place these five lengths\nin a random fashion on a single group of directions. We then rotate the configuration clockwise by \\(\\frac{2 \\pi}{199}\\) to cover other groups of directions and repeat until all groups of directions are exhausted. It follows that all vectors of each of the lengths \\(\\{0,4,8,12,16\\}\\) will form a regular 199-gon and will thus cancel each other out.\n\nWe have thus constructed a way of obtaining points \\(B_{i}\\) and have hence shown the existence of the 1990-gon satisfying \\((i)\\) and \\((i i)\\)."}

Now by Lemma \\(1,(k-1) b+1=k b-(b-1)\\) must be in \\(A\\); similarly, \\(k b+1=[(k-1) b+1]+b \\in A\\) as well.\n\nLet us show by induction that \\((n k-1) b+1, n k b+1 \\in A\\) for all integers \\(n\\). The inductive basis has been shown in Lemma 2. Assuming that \\([(n-\\) 1) \\(k-1] b+1 \\in A\\) and \\((n-1) k b+1 \\in A\\), we get that \\((n k-1) b+1=\\) \\(((n-1) k b+1)+(k-1) b=[((n-1) k-1) b+1]+k b\\) belongs to \\(A\\) and\n\\(n k b+1=((n k-1) b+1)+b=((n-1) k b+1)+k b \\Rightarrow n k b+1 \\in A\\). This finishes the inductive step. In particular, \\(f(k b, k b+1)=(k b+1) k b+1 \\in A\\). However, since \\(k b \\in C, k b+1 \\in A\\), it follows that \\(f(k b, k b+1) \\in B\\), which is a contradiction."}

Also, of the edges connecting any three of the 6 vertices other than \\(A, B, C, D\\), one is blue (because the edges joining them with \\(A\\) are not so). By a classical result, there is a blue triangle \\(E F G\\) with vertices among these six. Now one of \\(E B, E C, E D\\) must be blue as well, because none of \\(B C, B D, C D\\) is.

What we need is the number of such colorings of \\(T\\).\n\nThe border of the colored subregion \\(C\\) of \\(T\\) determines a path from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((q,-p)\\) consisting of consecutive unit moves either to the right or downwards. There are \\(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}p+q \\\\ p\\end{array}\\right)\\) such paths in total. We must find the number of such paths not going below the line \\(l: p x+q y=0\\).\n\nConsider any path \\(\\gamma=A_{0} A_{1} \\ldots A_{p+q}\\) from \\(A_{0}=(0,0)\\) to \\(A_{p+q}=(q,-p)\\). We shall see the path \\(\\gamma\\) as a sequence \\(G_{1} G_{2} \\ldots G_{p+q}\\) of moves to the right \\((R)\\) or downwards \\((D)\\) with exactly \\(p D\\) 's and \\(q R\\) 's.\n\nTwo paths are said to be equivalent if one is obtained from the other by a circular shift of the corresponding sequence \\(G_{1} G_{2} \\ldots G_{p+q}\\). We note that all the \\(p+q\\) circular shifts of a path are distinct. Indeed, \\(G_{1} \\ldots G_{p+q} \\equiv\\) \\(G_{i+1} \\ldots G_{i+p+q}\\) would imply \\(G_{1}=G_{i+1}=G_{2 i+1}=\\cdots\\left(\\right.\\) where \\(G_{j+p+q}=\\) \\(G_{j}\\) ), so \\(G_{1}=\\cdots=G_{p+q}\\), which is impossible. Hence each equivalence class contains exactly \\(p+q\\) paths.\n\nLet \\(l_{i}, 0 \\leq i<p+q\\), be the line through \\(A_{i}\\) that is parallel to the line \\(l\\). Since \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1\\), all these lines are distinct.\n\nLet \\(l_{m}\\) be the unique lowest line among the \\(l_{i}\\) 's. Then the path \\(G_{m+1} G_{m+2} \\ldots G_{m+p+q}\\) is above the line \\(l\\). Every other cyclic shift gives rise to a path having at least one vertex below the line \\(l\\). Thus each equiv-\nalence class contains exactly one path above the line \\(l\\), so the number of such paths is equal to \\(\\frac{1}{p+q}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}p+q \\\\ p\\end{array}\\right)\\). Therefore the answer is \\(\\frac{1}{p+q}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}p+q \\\\ p\\end{array}\\right)\\)."}

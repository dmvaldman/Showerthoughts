{"problem": "(a) We are given 80 coins of the same denomination; we know that one of them is counterfeit and that it is lighter than the others. Locate the counterfeit coin by using four weighings on a pan balance. (b) It is known that there is one counterfeit coin in a collection of \\(n\\) similar coins. What is the least number of weight trials necessary to identify the counterfeit?", "solution": "(a) We divide the coins into three groups: two having 27 coins each and one having 26 coins. A first weight trial is made by placing a group of 27 coins on each of the two pans. If the pans do not balance, the counterfeit coin is among those in the lighter pan. If the scale is in balance, the counterfeit coin is among the 26 unweighed coins. Therefore, it suffices to solve the following problem: To find, by three weight trials, a light counterfeit coin among 27 coins (the problem of detecting the counterfeit in the group of 26 coins can be reduced to this by simply adding to the set of 26 coins a genuine coin from the 54 which were weighed). For a second weight trial we divide the 27 coins into three groups of nine each and place a group of nine coins on each of the two pans. This will reveal which group of nine coins contains the counterfeit. The group of nine coins containing the counterfeit is then divided into three groups of three coins each. A third weight trial will tell which group of three coins contains the counterfeit. Finally, a fourth weight trial involving two of the three doubtful coins will reveal the counterfeit. (b) Let \\(k\\) be a natural number which satisfies the inequalities \\(3^{k} \\geqq n\\) and \\(3^{k-1}<n\\). We shall show that the number \\(k\\) satisfies the conditions of the problem. First we show that, at most, \\(k\\) weight trials are enough to allow detection of the counterfeit coin. We divide the coins into three groups such that in each of two equal groups there are \\(3^{k-1}\\) (or fewer) coins and the number of coins in the third group does not exceed \\(3^{k-1}\\) (this is possible for \\(n \\leqq 3^{k}\\) ). The two groups having the same number of coins are placed on the pans of the balance; this enables us to determine which group contains the counterfeit [see the solution to problem (a)]. If the group containing the counterfeit coin contains fewer than \\(3^{k-1}\\) coins, we add to it enough (genuine) coins from the other two groups to give it \\(3^{k-1}\\) coins. This group of \\(3^{k-1}\\) coins containing the counterfeit is again divided into three groups, as before, and a second weight trial is made, as before. The procedure is continued until after, at most, \\(k\\) weight trials we arrive at a group containing only one coin-that is, we have located the counterfeit coin. It is now necessary to show that \\(k\\) is the minimal number of weight trials which will guarantee the detection of the counterfeit coin under all circumstances. (Note: We might, under certain circumstances, succeed with fewer weight trials. For example, if two coins are chosen at random and compared, we might be fortunate enough to have chosen the counterfeit coin as one of them. However, this does not give us a procedure by which we can be sure, under all possible circumstances, of detecting the counterfeit by the required number of weight trials.) In each weight trial, as outlined above, the coins are divided into three groups, two of which are placed on each of the two pans, and the third being the unweighed group. If with an equal number of coins on each pan the scale balances, then, of course, the counterfeit is in the third group. If the pans are out of balance, we know that the counterfeit is on one of the pans, although a prior knowledge as to whether the counterfeit is lighter or heavier than the rest is needed to tell us on which of the two pans it lies. Let us assume that in an arbitrary sequence of weight trials the result of each weighing is least favorable with respect to enabling us to detect the counterfeit coin; that is the counterfeit is always in that group of three which contains the largest number of coins. Then upon each weight trial the number of coins in the group which contains the counterfeit will not be less than \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) the total number of coins (that is, upon division of the coins into three groups, one of the groups must contain not fewer than \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of them). Then after \\(k-1\\) weight trials the number of coins in the group containing the counterfeit will be not less than \\(\\frac{n}{3^{k-1}}\\), and, since \\(n>3^{k-1}\\), the counterfeit will not be found by \\(k-1\\) weight trials. Remark: It can be shown that the answer to the problem can be expressed in the following form: The minimal number of weight trials necessary to detect the one counterfeit coin in a collection of \\(n\\) coins is \\(\\left[\\log _{3}\\left(n-\\frac{1}{2}\\right]\\right)+1\\), where the brackets designate \"the largest integer in the number\" (see the note just prior to problem 101).", "hints_and_answers": "(a) For a first weighing, put 27 coins on each pan.

{"problem": "Twenty metal blocks are of the same size and external appearance; some are aluminum, and the rest are duraluminum, which is heavier. Using at most eleven weighings on a pan balance, how can we determine how many blocks are aluminum?", "solution": "One block is placed on each pan (first weight trial). There are two possible outcomes: On the first weight trial one of the pans is heavier. In this event one of the blocks must be aluminum and the other duraluminum. We now place both blocks on one pan and weigh them against pairs of remaining blocks (those being divided into nine pairs arbitrarily). Any pair of blocks which outweighs the first pair must consist of two duraluminum blocks. If the first pair is the heavier, then both blocks of the second pair are alminum. If both pairs balance, the second pair contains one aluminum and one duraluminum block. Thus, for this first event the number of duraluminum blocks can be determined by at most ten weight trials. On the first weight trial the pans balance. In this event both blocks are aluminum or both are duraluminum. As before, we now place both blocks on one pan and weigh them against pairs of remaining blocks. Assume that the first \\(k\\) pairs of blocks from the nine pairs have the same weight as the test blocks, and that the \\((k+1)\\) st pair tested have a different weight.

{"problem": "(a)* Among twelve similar coins there is one counterfeit. It is not known whether the counterfeit coin is lighter or heavier than a genuine one (all genuine coins weigh the same).

Remark: Using the conditions of problem (a) it is possible to locate, in three weighings, one counterfeit out of thirteen coins, but we cannnot determine whether it is light or heavy. For fourteen coins, four weighings are necessary. It would be interesting to determine the least number of weighings necessary to locate one counterfeit out of 1000 coins if we are relieved of the necessity of determining whether it is light or heavy.", "solution": "(a) Divide the coins into three sets of four coins each. For a first weight trial we place a group of four coins on each pan. There are two possibilities, which we shall investigate separately: (1) The pans balance. (2) One pan outweighs the other. The pans balance. In this event the counterfeit coin is in the unweighed set, and all eight coins on the scale are genuine. We number the coins of the doubtful group \\(1,2,3,4\\). We carry out second weight trial by placing coins 1,2 , and 3 on one pan and placing the other three coins now known to be genuine on the other pan. There are two possibilities: (A) The pans are in balance. In this event coin 4 is the counterfeit. A third weighing, comparing coin 4 with a genuine one, will tell whether it is lighter or heavier. (B) One pan is heavier. In this event the counterfeit is one of coins 1,2 , or 3 . If the genuine coins are the heavier, then the counterfeit is a light coin, and vice-versa. One more weight trial will identify which of coins 1,2 , or 3 is a light coin, hence counterfeit [see the solution to problem 4(a)]. If the pan containing coins 1,2 , and 3 is the heavier, then the counterfeit coin is heavier than a genuine one. One weight trial will identify it. One pan outweighs the other. In this event all the other coins are genuine. Let us designate the coins on the heavier pan by the numbers \\(1,2,3,4\\) (if one of these coins is false, then it is heavier than the others) and the coins on the lighter pan by \\(1^{\\prime}, 2^{\\prime}, 3^{\\prime}, 4^{\\prime}\\) (if one of these coins is false, then it is lighter than the others). A second weight trial is made by placing coins, 1,2 , and \\(1^{\\prime}\\) on one pan and coins 3,4 , and \\(2^{\\prime}\\) on the other. Again, there are several possibilities: (A) The pans balance. In this event the counterfeit coin is either \\(3^{\\prime}\\) or \\(4^{\\prime}\\) (and is lighter than a genuine coin). A third weight trial is made by placing coin \\(3^{\\prime}\\) on one pan and coin \\(4^{\\prime}\\) on the other; the lighter coin will be the counterfeit. (B) The pan containing coins 1,2 , and \\(1^{\\prime}\\) is heavier. In this event coins 3,4 , and \\(1^{\\prime}\\) are genuine; were either coin 3 or coin 4 heavier than the others, or were coin \\(1^{\\prime}\\) light, then in the second weight trial the pan containing coins 3,4 , and \\(2^{\\prime}\\) would have been heavy, which was not the result for this case. Therefore, the counterfeit coin is either coin 1 or coin 2 (and it is a heavier coin), or else it is coin \\(2^{\\prime}\\) (and it is a lighter coin). A third weight trial is made, placing coin 1 on one pan and coin 2 on the other. If the pans balance, then the counterfeit coin is \\(2^{\\prime}\\). If the pans fail to balance, then the counterfeit coin is on the heavier pan. (C) The pan containing coins 3,4 , and \\(2^{\\prime}\\) is heavier. Reasoning as before, we conclude that coins 1,2 , and \\(2^{\\prime}\\) are genuine and that if one of the coins 3 or 4 is counterfeit, then it is a heavier coin than the others, and if coin \\(1^{\\prime}\\) is the counterfeit, then it is lighter. A third weighing is made by placing coin 3 on one pan and coin 4 on the other. If the pans balance, then the counterfeit is \\(1^{\\prime}\\); if, on the other hand, one pan is heavier, then it contains the counterfeit coin. (b) We shall prove in three stages, (A), (B), (C), that if the number of coins is \\(N \\leqq \\frac{3^{n}-3}{2}\\), then the counterfeit coin can be detected (and determined to be heavy or light) by \\(n\\) weight trials, and if \\(N>\\frac{3^{n}-3}{2}\\), then \\(n\\) weighings do not necessarily suffice (see the hint to this problem). We shall solve first the following related problem, applying relaxed conditions. (A) Suppose we are given \\(N\\) coins, divided into two groups, which we shall designate \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (we do not exclude the possibility that one of the groups contains no coins). We assume that one of the \\(N\\) coins is counterfeit, and also that if the counterfeit is in the \\(X\\) group, then it is lighter than all the others, but if it is in group \\(Y\\) then it is heavier than all the others. We must show that if \\(N \\leqq 3^{n}\\), then the counterfeit coin can be detected by means of \\(n\\) weight trials on a pan balance, and if \\(N>3^{n}\\), then this is not always possible. \\({ }^{\\dagger}\\) If group \\(Y\\) contains no coins, the problem becomes as follows. There is one counterfeit coin among \\(N\\) coins, and it is lighter than the others; to prove: that if \\(N \\leqq 3^{n}\\), then the counterfeit can be found by \\(n\\) weight trials on a pan balance, and if \\(N>3^{n}\\), then this is not always possible; see problem \\(4(\\mathrm{~b})\\).] The proof will be given by mathematical induction. First we show that if \\(N \\leqq 3^{n}\\), the counterfeit can always be detected by \\(n\\) weight trials. If \\(n=1\\), that is if \\(N=1,2\\), or 3 , the proposition is quite \u2020 This statement has one obvious exception: If \\(N=2\\) and groups \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) each contains one coin, then, of course, the counterfeit coin cannot be detected. obvious (except as noted in the preceding footnote). For example, if \\(N=3\\), then it suffices to compare two of the coins from one group. Assume now that it has been shown that if \\(N \\leqq 3^{n-1}\\), then the counterfeit coin can be found by \\(n-1\\) weight trials. Now let \\(N \\leqq 3^{n}\\). Place on each pan \\(x\\) coins from group \\(X\\) and \\(y\\) coins from group \\(Y\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are selected to satisfy the inequalities \\[ \\begin{gathered} x+y \\leqq 3^{n-1} \\\\ N-2(x+y) \\leqq 3^{n-1} . \\end{gathered} \\] [For \\(N \\leqq 3^{n}\\) the inequality \\(N-2(x+y) \\leqq 3^{n}\\), or \\(x+y \\geqq \\frac{N-3^{n-1}}{2}\\) is compatible with \\(x+y \\leqq \\frac{3^{n}-3^{n-1}}{2}=3^{n-1}\\); that is, it is always possible to choose numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(\\left.3^{n-1} \\geqq x+y \\geqq \\frac{N-3^{n-1}}{2}\\right]\\). If the pans balance, the counterfeit coin is among the \\(N-2(x+y)\\) coins which were not placed on the scale; if one of the pans is heavier, the counterfeit is either among the \\(x\\) coins of group \\(X\\) on the lighter pan, or among the \\(y\\) coins of group \\(Y\\) on the heavier pan. But according to the induction hypothesis we can, in either event, find the counterfeit coin by conducting \\(n-1\\) additional weight trials [since both \\(N-2(x+y)\\) and \\((x+y)\\) fail to exceed \\(\\left.\\left.3^{n-1}\\right]\\right]^{\\uparrow}\\) This proves, by induction, that if \\(N \\leqq 3^{n}\\), then \\(n\\) weight trials suffice for finding the counterfeit. We now prove that if \\(N>3^{n}\\), then the counterfeit cannot, in general, be detected by \\(n\\) weight trials. (By \"in general\" we mean that there simply does not exist a sure program which will always locate the false coin in \\(n\\) trials. There is always the possibility, for example, that if we select two coins at random, one of them might be the counterfeit; but we are not concerned with this sort of accidental success.) For this proof we make an additional assumption to relax our conditions. We assume that in addition to the two sets \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) of coins, together containing \\(N>3^{n}\\) coins, we have at our disposal a quantity of coins all known to be genuine. We designate this last group of coins by \\(Z\\) (how many there are is not important). We shall show, by using these auxiliary coins, that the counterfeit cannot, in general, be found by \\(n\\) weight trials. It is easily verified that if \\(n=1\\) (that is, if the total number \\(N\\) of coins in \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) exceeds 3), then one weighing will not always suf- \\(\\dagger\\) If \\(N>2\\), then \\(x=1, y=1\\) is not an exception, because there are now, beyond the two coins, some number of coins known to be genuine. Comparison of one of the genuine coins with either one of the doubtful coins will enable us to find the counterfeit by one weighing. fice to locate the counterfeit coin. Assume now that it has been proved that if the number \\(N\\) of coins in groups \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) exceeds \\(3^{n-1}\\), then it is not, in general, possible to detect the counterfeit by \\(n-1\\) weight trials. We must show, then, that in this event if \\(N>3^{n}\\), the counterfeit cannot always be detected in \\(n\\) weight trials. Suppose that in the first weight trial we have placed on the first pan \\(x\\) coins from group \\(X, y\\) coins from group \\(Y\\), and \\(z\\) coins from auxiliary group \\(Z\\), and that we have put on the other pan \\(x^{\\prime}\\) coins from group \\(X\\) and \\(y^{\\prime}\\) coins from group \\(Y\\), so that \\(x+y+z=x^{\\prime}+y^{\\prime}\\) (clearly, it would be useless to put coins from \\(Z\\) on both pans). Let \\(w\\) be the number of coins of groups \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) which have been left off the scale \\(\\left(x+x^{\\prime}+y+y^{\\prime}+w=N\\right)\\). Now the scale may be in balance, the counterfeit is among those coins not placed on the scale. If \\(w\\) exceeds \\(3^{n-1}\\), then, by our induction hypothesis, \\(n-1\\) additional weighings will not, in general, suffice to locate the counterfeit there, and we will already have used up one weight trial. Thus, on the first weight trial, in order to guarantee even the possibility that \\(n\\) trials will suffice, it is necessary that \\(w \\leqq 3^{n-1}\\). Hence, on this first trial, \\[ x+y+x^{\\prime}+y^{\\prime}=N-3^{n-1}>3^{n}-3^{n-1}=2 \\cdot 3^{n-1} . \\] If the pans do not balance, the imbalance is caused either by a light counterfeit in the \\(X\\) group or by a heavy counterfeit in the \\(Y\\) group. Hence, we must deal with either a group of \\(x+y^{\\prime}\\) coins (if the pan with \\(x+y+z\\) coins is lighter) or a group of \\(x^{\\prime}+y\\) doubtful coins. But according to the relation \\(x+y+x^{\\prime}+y^{\\prime}>2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}\\), the larger of the numbers \\(x+y^{\\prime}\\) and \\(x^{\\prime}+y\\) exceeds \\(3^{n-1}\\). We must be prepared to deal with this larger number of coins, and according to the induction hypothesis \\(n-1\\) additional weight trials will not always suffice to identify the counterfeit. This induction completes the proof of case (A). (B) Suppose we are given \\(N\\) coins containing one counterfeit which differs in weight from the others, but that we do not know whether the counterfeit is lighter or heavier. Assume we have available an extra coin which we know to be genuine. We shall show that if \\[ N \\leqq \\frac{3^{n}-1}{2}: \\] the counterfeit can always be detected by \\(n\\) weight trials; the counterfeit can be shown to be lighter or heavier than the genuine coins; for \\[ N>\\frac{3^{n}-1}{2} \\] \\(n\\) weight trials do not, in general, suffice. First, let \\(N \\leqq \\frac{3^{n}-1}{2}\\). If \\(n=1\\) (that is, if \\(N=1\\) ), one weighing will obviously suffice. Assume that for \\[ N \\leqq \\frac{3^{n-1}-1}{2} \\] \\(n-1\\) weight trials suffice we shall show that for \\[ N \\leqq \\frac{3^{n}-1}{2} \\] \\(n\\) weight trials will suffice. We place on one of the pans \\(x\\) of the \\(N\\) given coins together with the extra genuine coin, and we place on the other pan \\(x+1\\) coins. There remain \\(N-2 x-1\\) unweighed coins. We choose the number \\(x\\) to satisfy the requirement \\[ \\begin{aligned} 2 x+1 & \\leqq 3^{n-1} \\\\ N-2 x-1 & \\leqq \\frac{3^{n-1}-1}{2} . \\end{aligned} \\] It is clear that such an \\(x\\) can always be chosen if \\(N \\leqq \\frac{3^{n}-1}{2}\\) (in this case, \\(N-\\frac{3^{n-1}-1}{2} \\leqq \\frac{3^{n}-1}{2}-\\frac{3^{n-1}-1}{2}=3^{n-1}\\) ). If the pans balance, then there remain \\[ N-2 x-1 \\leqq \\frac{3^{n-1}-1}{2} \\] unweighed coins plus a quantity of coins (those on the balance) known to be genuine. Therefore, according to case (A) we can find the counterfeit coin by making not more than \\(n-1\\) additional weight trials. If the pans do not balance, then the \\(x\\) coins on one pan and the \\(x+1\\) coins on the other pan form two groups containing a total of \\(2 x+1 \\leqq 3^{n-1}\\) coins, to which we can apply the result of problem A just investigated. Therefore, \\(n-1\\) further weight trials at most, suffice here also. This completes the proof that, under the conditions of this case, if \\[ N \\leqq \\frac{3^{n-1}-1}{2}, \\] then \\(n\\) weight trials suffice to identify the counterfeit. We now show that if \\[ N \\geqq \\frac{3^{n}-1}{2}, \\] then it is not always possible to solve the problem with only \\(n\\) weight trials. For \\(n=1\\) (that is, for \\(N>1\\) ) one weighing will not be enough. Once more we proceed by induction. Assume that for \\[ N>\\frac{3^{n-1}-1}{2} \\] it has already been shown that \\(n-1\\) weight trials are not enough. We investigate the event \\[ N>\\frac{3^{n}-1}{2} . \\] We place on one of the pans \\(x\\) of the \\(N\\) coins and, in addition, \\(z\\) coins known to be genuine (here we may assume that we have not just one but many genuine coins at our disposal). We place on the other pan \\(x+z\\) coins from the given set \\(N\\). Let us designate by \\(w\\) the number of coins from \\(N\\) which remain off the balance. Inasmuch as the pans may be in balance, the number \\(w\\) of coins left off the balance must not exceed \\(\\frac{3^{n-1}-1}{2}\\); if the number does exceed this value, then, according to the induction hypothesis, \\(n\\) weight trials will not suffice to locate the counterfeit. But in this event \\(2 x+z>3^{n-1}\\) (or, \\(N>\\frac{3^{n}-1}{2}\\) ). If the balance is not in equilibrium, we can apply to the coins belonging to groups \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), which are made up of the doubtful coins and which lie on one or the other of the pans, the results of case (A). It follows from the inequality \\(2 x+z>3^{n-1}\\) that for the unbalanced condition of the scale, \\(n\\) weight trials do not suffice. (C) Having obtained the foregoing preliminary results, we now return to the original problem. We shall prove that given \\(N\\) coins, where \\[ 2<N \\leqq \\frac{3^{n}-3}{2}, \\] one of which is counterfeit (but it is not known whether it is lighter or heavier than the others), the counterfeit can be detected by \\(n\\) weight trials and simultaneously shown to be either light or heavy. \\({ }^{\\dagger}\\) If we place \\(x\\) coins on each pan, there remain \\(N-2 x\\) coins not on the scale. The number \\(x\\) is selected such that \\[ \\begin{gathered} 2 x \\leqq 3^{n-1}, \\\\ N-2 x \\leqq \\frac{3^{n-1}-1}{2} . \\end{gathered} \\] \\footnotetext{ t Clearly, if only two coins are involved, the counterfeit cannot be found by weighing. } If the pans balance, then the false coin is among the unweighed ones, of which there are \\[ N-2 x \\leqq \\frac{3^{n-1}-1}{2} \\] Moreover, we now have on hand \\(2 x\\) coins known to be genuine, and in view of the result obtained in case (B) we are able to find the counterfeit by \\(n-1\\) additional weight trials. If one of the pans outweighs the other, then we can apply the result of case \\(\\mathrm{A}\\) to the coins on the scale, since the total number of coins on the two pans is \\(2 x<3^{n-1}\\), and \\(n-1\\) additional weight trials suffice to locate the counterfeit. We shall now prove that if \\[ N>\\frac{3^{n}-3}{2} \\] then \\(n\\) weight trials will not, in general, suffice. For the first weight trial we place \\(x\\) coins on each pan, leaving \\(w\\) coins off the scale. If the pans balance, then in view of case (B), \\(n-1\\) further weight trials will suffice to locate the counterfeit and to determine whether it is light or heavy only if \\(w\\) does not exceed \\(\\frac{3^{n-1}-1}{2}\\). But in this event \\[ 2 x>\\frac{3^{n}-3}{2}-\\frac{3^{n-1}-1}{2}=\\frac{2 \\cdot 3^{n-1}-2}{2}=3^{n-1}-1 \\text {. } \\] Since \\(2 x\\) is an even number, \\(2 x>3^{n-1}\\), and in view of the results of case (A), we cannot determine the counterfeit coin with \\(n\\) weight trials if one of the pans is heavier. Thus, we have proved the generalized version of the given problem. Now we need note merely that \\[ \\frac{3^{7}-3}{2}=1092>1000>363=\\frac{3^{6}-3}{2} \\] in order to obtain the answer to our specific problem; that is, \\(k=7\\).", "hints_and_answers": "(a) For a first weighing, put four coins on each pan.

{"problem": "(a) A traveler having no money, but owning a gold chain having seven links, is accepted at an inn on the condition that he pay one link per day for his stay. If the traveler is to pay daily, but may take change in the form of links previously paid, and if he remains seven days, what is the least number of links that must be cut out of the chain? (Note: A link may be taken from any part of the chain.) (b) A chain consists of 2000 links. What is the least number of links that must be disengaged from the chain in order that any specified number of links, from 1 to 2000 , may be gathered together from the parts of the chain thus formed?", "solution": "(a) If the third link is disengaged from the chain, then there are three pieces: the single link, a two-link piece, and a four-link piece. On the first day the traveler gives the single link to the innkeeper. On the second day he gives the innkeeper the two-link piece, receiving the single link back in change. On the third day the traveler pays the single link; on the fourth day he presents the four- link piece, receiving as change the single link and the two-link piece. On the fifth day he gives the single link, and on the sixth day the single link is returned to him as change for the two link piece. Finally, the single link pays for the seventh day's lodging. Hence, only one link need be disengaged from the chain. (b) It will be convenient to consider first the following problem. If \\(k\\) links are disengaged from an \\(n\\)-link chain, where \\(k\\) is a fixed number, how large can \\(n\\) be such that any number of links from 1 to \\(n\\) can be obtained by taking one or more of the severed pieces of the chain? To solve this problem, we first investigate which links would be most advantageous to remove. After removing \\(k\\) single links we can gather from these any number of links from 1 to \\(k\\). But if we want \\(k+1\\) links, we must consider the remaining pieces of chain and in particular those pieces having \\(k+1\\) or fewer links. Clearly, the most convenient arrangement would be to have a piece of chain with exactly \\(k+1\\) links. Then we could gather any number of links from 1 to \\(2 k+1\\). In order to collect \\(2 k+2=2(k+1)\\) links, we need another piece containing \\(2(k+1)\\), or fewer, links. The most convenient situation would be to have a piece with exactly \\(2(k+1)\\) links; we could then gather any number of links from 1 te \\((2 k+1)+2(k+1)=\\) \\(4 k+3\\). The next step would be to have available a piece of chain with \\(4 k+4=4(k+1)\\) links. Continuing this reasoning, the most advantageous method of removing links from the chain would be to have pieces of the following lengths (setting aside the individual severed links): \\[ k+1,2(k+1), 4(k+1), 8(k+1), \\cdots, 2^{k}(k+1) \\text {. } \\] Thus, any number of links from 1 to \\[ \\begin{aligned} n & =k+\\left[(k+1)+2(k+1)+4(k+1)+\\cdots+2^{k}(k+1)\\right] \\\\ & =k+\\left(2^{k+1}-1\\right)(k+1)=2^{k+1}(k+1)-1 \\end{aligned} \\] can be built up by taking pieces of the chain. Thus, if \\(2^{k} k \\leqq n \\leqq 2^{k+1}(k+1)-1\\), then it is possible to make \\(k\\) breaks in the chain, but removal of \\(k-1\\) links will not suffice to solve the problem. In particular, if \\[ \\begin{array}{rlrl} 2 & \\leqq n \\leqq 7, \\text { then } k=1 ; & & 160 \\leqq n \\leqq 383, \\text { then } k=5 ; \\\\ 8 & \\leqq n \\leqq 23, \\text { then } k=2 ; & & 384 \\leqq n \\leqq 895, \\text { then } k=6 ; \\\\ 24 & \\leqq n \\leqq 63, \\text { then } k=3 ; & 896 \\leqq n \\leqq 2047, \\text { then } k=7 \\\\ 64 \\leqq n \\leqq 159, \\text { then } k & =4 ; & & \\end{array} \\] Therefore, if \\(n=2000\\), the least number of links which can be disengaged is 7 . The conditions of the problem will be satisfied if we select those links such that the 8 pieces of chain we obtain (excluding the 7 individual severed links) have, respectively, \\(8,16,32,64,128\\), 256,512 , and 977 links.", "hints_and_answers": "(a) One link.

{"problem": "Given thirteen gears, each weighing an integral number of grams. It is known that any twelve of them may be placed on a pan balance, six on each pan, in such a way that the scale will be in equilibrium. Prove that all the gears must be of equal weight.", "solution": "First, it follows from the conditions of the problem that each gear weighs either an even number of grams or an odd number of grams. The reasoning is as follows. Since any set of twelve gears can be divided into two groups of equal weight, a set of twelve gears will weigh an even number of grams. This total weight remains an even number if one of the twelve gears is exchanged with the thirteenth gear. But this is possible only if the exchanged gear and the thirteenth gear are both of even weight or both of odd weight, and this holds for any of the twelve gears initially weighed. Hence, all the gears are of even, or all are of odd, weight. Subtract now from the weight of each gear the weight of the lightest gear (possibly two or more gears have the same minimum weight; this is unimportant). This may be thought of as producing a \"new\" set of gears, and this new set clearly again satisfies the conditions of the problem. (One of the gears, and possibly more, must now be thought of as having \"zero weight\".) It is easily seen that each gear of the new set has even weight (counting 0 as an even number), since if all the gears were of odd weight initially, then an odd number was subtracted from each individual weight; if they were all of even weight initially, then an even number was subtracted from each individual weight. If now we divide each weight by 2 and think of this as providing a \"new\" set of weights, this new set again satisfies the conditions of the problem. Assume now that not all the gears are of the same weight. In this case, not all the weights of the second set (obtained by subtracting the weights of the lightest gear from each of the original weights) will be zero. If we continue to divide by 2, thus obtaining \"new\" sets satisfying the conditions of the problem, we finally arrive at a set of gears of which some are of even weight (at least one is of zero weight) and some are of odd weight (continued division of an even natural number by 2 finally produces an odd number). But such a set satisfying the conditions of the problem has been shown to be impossible. This contradiction proves the assertion of the problem. Remark: The conditions of the problem require that all the gears be of integral weight, but the result can be extended to weights which are rational numbers. If we multiply each of the weights by the least common multiple of all the denominators, we obtain a \"new\" set of weights, all integers, and all of which still satisfy the conditions of the problem, and we go on from there. Moreover, if we allow the weights to be irrational numbers, the extension can again be made, since irrational numbers can be approximated by rational numbers to as close a tolerance as desired. (The reader is invited to carry out such a proof, although a rigorous demonstration is by no means a simple task.)", "hints_and_answers": "Prove first that all the weights are even or odd."}

The problem can be solved more readily and with much less calculation if we consider the conditions imposed on the total number of coconuts. The first condition asserts that the first division of the total number of nuts by 5 yields a remainder of 1 , that is, for some number \\(l, N=5 l+1\\). The numbers \\(N\\) satisfying this condition appear in the sequence of natural numbers at intervals five integers apart, and if we know one of the numbers, we can find as many more as we wish by adding or subtracting multiples of 5 . The second condition asserts that \\(k=(4 / 5)(N-1)=4 l(k\\) is the number of nuts remaining for the second man's raid) gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 ; that is, \\(k=5 l_{1}+1\\), for the suitable \\(l_{1}\\). This is equivalent to the requirement that \\(l\\) yield a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 , or that \\(N=5 l+1\\) yield a remainder of 21 when divided by 25. Numbers satisfying this condition are found in the natural number sequence at intervals of 25 , and if we know one such number, we can obtain the others by adding or subtracting mutliples of 25 . The third condition asserts that \\(k_{1}=(4 / 5)(k-1)=\\) \\(4 l_{1}\\) yields a remainder of 1 upon division by 5 ; this condition determines the remainder yielded upon division of \\(l_{1}\\) by 5 , or the remainders obtained by dividing \\(k\\) and \\(l\\) by 25 , or the remainder obtained by dividing \\(N\\) by 125 . All the conditions together determine the remainder obtained by dividing \\(N\\) by \\(5^{6}=15,625\\). These numbers appear at intervals of 15,625 in the sequence of natural numbers. \\({ }^{\\dagger}\\) We can now calculate the remainder which \\(N\\) yields upon division by \\(5^{6}\\), but this is not necessary. One number satisfying all the imposed conditions is -4 , which upon division by 5 yields a quotient of -1 and a remainder of +1 . If we subtract the number 1 from -4 and divide the difference by \\(4 / 5\\), then divide the result by 5 , we again obtain a remainder of +1 . Accordingly, upon all further divisions by 5 we will obtain the same remainder of +1 . The number -4 cannot, of course, be the answer to the problem, since \\(N\\) has to be a positive integer. But since we do know one number which satisfies the conditions of the problem, we can find as many others as we wish by adding multiples of \\(5^{6}\\).

Let \\(d\\) represent the digit in the tens place of the number \\(n\\), and let \\(e\\) be the digit in the units place; then \\(n=\\) \\(10 d+e\\), and \\[ N=(10 d+e)^{2}=100 d^{2}+20 d e+e^{2} \\text {. } \\] It follows, from the manner in which the money was divided, and since the older brother had one more selection from the money than did his brother, that there must have been an odd number of tens in \\(N\\), plus a remaining number less than 10 . But \\(100 d^{2}+20 d e=\\) \\(20 d(5 d+e)\\) is divisible by 20 and so contains an even number of tens. Consequently, the number \\(e^{2}\\) must contain an odd number of tens.

Of these numbers, only 16 and 36 contain an odd number of tens, so the possibilities for \\(e^{2}\\) are limited to 16 or 36 . Both of these numbers end with the digit 6 , which means that the remainder the younger brother received in place of 10 rubles was 6 rubles. Thus, the older brother received 4 rubles more than did the younger. To make the division even, the older brother would have to give the \\footnotetext{ t The argument here would be carried out in American schools by the use of congruence arithmetic [Editor]. } younger brother 2 rubles.

{"problem": "(a) On which of the two days of the week, Saturday or Sunday, does New Year's Day fall more often? (b) On which day of the week does the thirtieth of the month most often fall?", "solution": "(a) Our calendar is constructed on the following scheme. Every year has 365 days except for leap-years (those years whose identifying number is divisible by 4 -for example, 1960). The leap-years have 366 days (the extra day being February 29). However, there is an exception to this rule: any year whose identifying number is divisible by 100 but not by 400 has only 365 days instead of 366; that is, those are not leap years. For example, the years 1800 and 1900 were not leap years; also, 2100 will not be a leap year. However, 2000 (being divisible by 400) will be a leap year. The problem asks on which of the two days, Saturday or Sunday, New Years Day more frequently falls. We shall show that any 400 -year period of time presents a periodic pattern, in the sense that the next 400 -year period will exactly duplicate the calendars of the previous 400 -year period (for example, this month's calender is exactly the same as that of exactly 400 years ago). This interval of 400 years contains an integral number of weeks. Leap years have 52 weeks and 2 days, and other years have 52 weeks and 1 day. In the course of four years, of which one is a leap year, there are 4.52 weeks plus 5 days. In the course of 400 years there would be an additional 500 days, but because three of these years are divisible by 100 but not by 400 (and so are not leap years) the 400 years will have only 497 days in addition to 400.52 weeks; that is, there are an additional 71 weeks. Therefore, the problem can be limited to any 400 -year period. Let us investigate the 400 -year period from 1901 to 2301 . Every fourth year is a leap year (since there is no exception for leap years in this interval). In span of 28 years there will be one \"extra\" week, owing to leap years; in addition, there will be an additional 28 days, or 4 weeks, over an exact number of weeks. Thus, a 28 -year interval yields an integral number of weeks: \\(28 \\cdot 52+5\\) weeks. We select a particular New Year's Day: January 1, 1952, which fell on a Tuesday. Since 1952 was a leap year, and a leap year has 2 days over 52 weeks, January 1, 1953, fell on a Thursday, but january 1, 1954, fell on a Friday (1953 not being a leap year), January 1, 1955, fell on a Saturday, and so on. January 1, 1951, fell on a Monday, January, 1, 1950, fell on a Sunday, and so on. In the 28year period 1929-1956, inclusive, January 1 fell exactly four times on each day of the week. This distribution was exactly the same for the 28 -year period \\(1901-1928\\), inclusive. We recall that a 28 -year period in which every fourth year is a leap year contains an integral number of weeks, and, consequently, we repeat the same distribution of New Year's Days over the days of the week as obtained for the previous 28-year period. The interval 1901-2096 (inclusive) contains 196 years, a number divisible by 28 (the year 2000 not providing any exception for leap year). In this interval, New Year's Day will have fallen exactly the same number of times on each day of the week. Further, January 1, 2097, will fall on the same day of the week as did january 1, 1901, January 1, 1929, and so on-it will fall on a Tuesday. Thus, New Year's Day of 2100 will fall on a Friday, and New Year's Day of 2101 will fall on a Saturday (2100 is not a leap year). The 28-year period 2101-2128 will differ from the 28 -year period 19011928 in that the period begins not on a Tuesday but on a Saturday. This calls for a corresponding shift in the days on which New Year's Day will fall. However, in the period 1901-1928 New Year's Day fell exactly four times on each day of the week, and this will happen also in the period 2101-2128. The 28-year intervals 2129-2156 and 2157-2184 will follow the same pattern. The year 2185 begins on the same day as did 2101 -Saturday; this allows us to find the data for the period 2185 to 2201 . Simple calculation shows that in the interval from 2185 to 2200 New Year's Day will fall twice each on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, but three times each on Sunday and Tuesday. New Year's Day of 2201 will fall on a Thursday. In the course of the \\(3.28=84\\) years, from 2201 to 2284 , New Year's Day will fall the same number of times on each day of the week. New Year's Day 2285 will fall on the same day it will in 2201-Thursday. This allows us to determine the data for the period 2285-2300. In this interval January 1 will fall twice each on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and three times each on Sunday and Friday. Similarly, over these periods in the course of which New Year's Day will fall the same number of times on each day we counted \\(2+2=4\\) Mondays, \\(1+3+2=6\\) Tuesdays, \\(1+2+2=5\\) Wednesdays, \\(1+2+2=5\\) Thursdays, 6 Fridays, 4 Saturdays, and 6 Sundays. It follows that New Year's Day falls more often on Sunday than on Saturday. (b) Employing methods analogous to those used in problem (a), we can show that in the 400 -year interval the thirtieth day of the month will fall on Sunday 687 times, on Monday 685 times, on Tuesday 685 times, on Wednesday 687 times, on Thursday 684 times, on Friday 688 times, and on Saturday 684 times. Thus, the thirtieth day of the month falls most often on a Friday.", "hints_and_answers": "(a) The rule for the alternation of the number of days in the year is as follows: Each year whose total number of days is divisible by 4 is a leap year (has an extra day), with the exception of those years divisible by 100 but not by 400 . It is easy to see that 400 years contain an integral number of weeks. Consequently, it remains to prove whether the new year begins most often with a Saturday or a Sunday for any 400 -year period. Answer: With Sunday. (b) On Saturday."}
{"problem": "Which integers have the following property? If the final digit is deleted, the integer is divisible by the new number.", "solution": "It is clear that if the final digit of an integer is deleted, the integer is reduced by a factor of at least 10 . If that final digit is zero then, of course, the number is reduced by exactly the factor 10 , and so all such numbers automatically satisfy the conditions of the problem. Assume now that if the final digit of a number \\(x\\) is deleted, then the digit is reduced by an integral factor exceeding 10, say, by the factor \\(10+a(a \\geqq 1)\\). Let \\(y\\) be the quotient obtained by dividing \\(x\\) by 10 , and let \\(z\\) be the remainder; that is, \\(x=10 y+z(z \\leqq 9)\\). If the last digit of \\(x\\) is deleted, then the deleted digit is \\(z\\), and the new number is equal to \\(y\\). The condition of the problem then calls for the equation \\[ x=(10+a) \\cdot y, \\] or the equation \\[ 10 y+z=(10+a) \\cdot y, \\] from which we obtain \\[ z=a y . \\] Since \\(z<10\\), both \\(a\\) and \\(y\\) must be less than 10 . Therefore, except for the numbers divisible by 10 , the only integers meeting the conditions of the problem are two-digit numbers; also, if the final digit is deleted, the original integer can be reduced by, at most, a factor of \\(19(11 \\leqq 10+a<19)\\). It is easily shown that only the following two-digit numbers are reduced by a factor of 11 when their last digit is deleted: \\(11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99\\). (If \\(10+a=11\\), then \\(a=1\\); hence \\(z=a y=y\\), and \\(x=10 y+z=11 y\\), where \\(y=1,2,3, \\cdots, 9\\).) It can be shown, in an analogous way, that the only two-digit integers reduced by a factor of 12 upon deletion of the final digit are 12, 24, \\(36,48(z=a y=2 y\\), where only \\(y=1,2,3,4\\) are possible, since \\(z<10\\), and \\(x=12 y\\) ). The numbers diminished by a factor of 13 are 13,26 , 39 ; the numbers diminished by a factor of 14 are 14 and 28 .

It may be written in the form \\(6 \\cdot 10^{k}+y\\), where \\(y\\) is a \\(k\\)-digit number (it may possibly begin with one or more zeros). The conditions of the problem are expressed by \\[ 6 \\cdot 10^{k}+y=25 y, \\] or \\[ y=\\frac{6 \\cdot 10^{k}}{24} \\text {. } \\] Clearly, it is necessary that \\(k \\geqq 2\\), since 60 is not divisible exactly by 24 and \\(y\\) is an integer. For \\(k \\geqq 2\\) the integer \\(y\\) is equal to \\(25 \\cdot 10^{\\prime-2}\\); that is, \\(y\\) has the form \\(250 \\cdots 0\\), where there are \\(k-2\\) zeros. Therefore, all the numbers sought are of the form \\(6250 \\cdots 0\\), where there are \\(n\\) zeros and \\(n=0,1,2,3, \\cdots\\). (b) Solve this problem: Find a number whose first digit is \\(a\\) and which is reduced by a factor of 35 when its final digit is deleted Proceeding as in problem (a), we have the equation \\[ y=\\frac{a \\cdot 10^{k}}{34} \\] where \\(y\\) is an integer [see solution of problem (a)]. But the right member of this equation cannot possibly be an integer \\(a \\leqq 9\\) and \\(k \\geqq 1\\). Remark: Proceeding as we did in problems 16 (a) and (b), we can show that an integer beginning with a given digit a can be reduced by an integral factor \\(b\\) upon deletion of the digit \\(a\\) only if \\(a<b-1\\) and the (proper) fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b-1}\\) can be represented as a finite decimal fraction (that is, all the prime factors of \\(b-1\\) other than 2 and 5 are factors of \\(a\\), of sufficient multiplicity). For example, no integer can be reduced by a factor of 85 by deleting its first digit, since \\(85-1=84\\) includes 3 and 7 among its factors and no digit is divisible by both 3 and 7. Again, any number which is reduced by a factor of 15 upon deletion of its first digit must commence with 7 , since 14 has 7 as a factor.

(a) Prove that division of this resulting integer by 9 results in deleting an additional digit. (b) Find all integers satisfying the conditions of the problem.", "solution": "(a) First we show that no integer can be diminished to : its original value by deleting a digit standing farther from its beginning than the second place. Let the digits of the number \\(N\\) be \\(a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots\\), \\(a^{n}\\left(a_{0} \\neq 0\\right)\\); that is, \\[ a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n}+a_{1} \\cdot 10^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{n}=N . \\] Assume that \\(\\frac{N}{9}\\) is an integer, and that it has been obtained by deleting a digit past the second position. We have \\[ a_{0} 10^{n-1}+a_{1} 10^{n-2}+\\cdots=\\frac{N}{9} \\] If we multiply this equation by 10 and subtract from it the initial equation for \\(N\\), we obtain \\[ \\frac{N}{9}<10^{n-1} \\] This is a contradiction, since \\(\\frac{N}{10}\\) is a smaller number, and \\[ \\frac{N}{10}=a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n-1}+\\cdots \\geqq 10^{n-1} \\] We recall the criterion for divisibility of an integer by 9 (a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9). Now, if \\(N\\) is divisible by 9 , as is also the number obtained from \\(N\\) by deleting the first digit of \\(N\\), then this first digit must be 0 or 9 (since it must by itself be divisible by 9 ). Since \\(a_{0} \\neq 0\\), we must have \\(a_{0}=9\\) if \\(N\\) is to meet the conditions of the problem. But then the number \\(\\frac{N}{9}\\) has the same number of digits as does \\(N\\), and so \\(\\frac{N}{9}\\) cannot be obtained from \\(N\\) by deleting its first digit. This contradiction means that the only possible deletion of a digit from \\(N\\) in order to meet the conditions given by the problem is that of the second digit. Thus, \\[ \\frac{N}{9}=a_{0} 10^{n-1}+a_{2} 10^{n-2}+\\cdots+a_{n} \\] Since \\(\\frac{N}{9}\\) must again be divisible by 9 (that is, \\(a_{0}+a_{2}+a_{3}+\\cdots+a_{n}\\) is a multiple of 9 , as was \\(a_{0}+a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}\\) ) either \\(a_{1}=0\\) or \\(a_{1}=9\\). If we assume that \\(a_{1}=9\\), and if we multiply the expansion for \\(\\frac{N}{9}\\) by 10 and subtract the expansion for \\(N\\), we obtain \\(\\frac{N}{9}=\\) \\(\\left(a_{2}-9\\right) \\cdot 10^{n-1}+\\cdots\\), and since \\(a_{2} \\leqq 9\\), then \\[ \\frac{N}{9}<10^{n-1} \\] which is impossible. Therefore, the conditions of the problem can be met only if the second digit of \\(N\\) is zero and if this is the digit deleted. Thus, \\[ N-\\frac{N}{9}=a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n}-a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n-1} \\] or \\[ \\frac{N}{9}=N-a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n}+a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n-1}=N-a_{0} \\cdot 9 \\cdot 10^{n-1} \\] Finally, \\[ \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot \\frac{N}{9}=\\frac{N}{9}-a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n-1} . \\] This equation states that to divide \\(\\frac{N}{9}\\) by 9 , we merely delete the first digit \\(a_{0}\\). This solves problem (a). (b) In solving problem (a) we arrived at the necessary relation \\[ \\frac{N}{9}=N-a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n-1} \\cdot 9 \\] from which it follows, upon solving for \\(N\\), that \\[ N=\\frac{a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n-1} \\cdot 81}{8} . \\] This is the form that \\(N\\) must have. It is evident that \\(a_{0}\\) cannot be either of the digits 8 or 9 , inasmuch as the second digit of \\(N\\) is required to be zero. If we try successively \\(a_{0}=1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\), along with the least necessary value of \\(n\\) which will make \\(N\\) an integer, we have the following seven numbers, which satisfy the conditions of the problem: \\[ 10,125 ; 2025 ; 30,375 ; 405 ; 50,625 ; 6075 ; 70,875 \\text {. } \\] These numbers, together with all products by \\(10^{k}(k=1,2,3, \\cdots)\\) constitute all the integers which satisfy the conditions of the problem.", "hints_and_answers": "(a) Prove the number can be reduced to \\(\\frac{1}{9}\\) its value only on deleting the digit zero, which must stand in the second position.

{"problem": "(a) Find all integers having the property that when the third digit is deleted the resulting number divides the original one. (b)* Find all integers with the property that when the second digit is deleted the resulting number divides the original one.", "solution": "(a) The proposition is equivalent to the assertion that the integer is diminished by some factor \\(m\\) when the third digit is deleted. Let \\[ N=a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n}+a_{1} \\cdot 10^{n-1}+a_{2} \\cdot 10^{n-2}+\\cdots+a_{n} . \\] Then \\[ 10 \\cdot \\frac{N}{m}=a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n}+a_{1} \\cdot 10^{n-1}+a_{3} \\cdot 10^{n-2}+\\cdots+a_{n} \\cdot 10 \\] If \\(m<10\\), then subtraction of the first equation from the second yields the inequality \\(\\frac{10-m}{m} N<10^{n-1}\\), which is impossible, since \\[ \\frac{10-m}{m}>\\frac{1}{10} \\] and \\[ \\frac{1}{10} N=a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n-1}+\\cdots \\geqq 10^{n-1} . \\] If \\(m>11\\), then \\(\\frac{m-10}{m} \\cdot N<10^{n-1}\\), which also is impossibile for an analogous reason \\(\\left(\\frac{m-10}{m}>\\frac{1}{10}\\right)\\). Again, if \\(m=11\\), then we must have \\(\\frac{1}{11} N<10^{n-1}\\); that is, \\(\\frac{N}{m}=\\frac{N}{11}\\) has two digits fewer than \\(N\\), which is an impossibility. The only possibility of obtaining a number satisfying the conditions of the problem is to let \\(m=10\\). Therefore, the conditions require numbers all of whose digits, except the first two, are zero. Such integers satisfy the requirement and hence describe the numbers sought. Remark: It is possible to show, by similar reasoning, that the only integers which are diminished by an integral factor when the \\(k\\) th digit, where \\(k>3\\), is deleted are those having zeros after the first \\(k-1\\) digits. (b) The requirement that a number \\(N\\) be diminished by an integral factor \\(m\\) when its second digit is deleted is expressed as follows: \\[ \\begin{aligned} N & =a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n}+a_{1} \\cdot 10^{n-1}+a_{2} \\cdot 10^{n-2}+\\cdots+a_{n} \\\\ \\frac{N}{m} & =a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n-1}+a_{2} \\cdot 10^{n-2}+\\cdots+a_{n} . \\end{aligned} \\] It follows that \\[ \\frac{N}{m}=N-a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n}-a_{1} \\cdot 10^{n-1}+a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n-1}, \\] or, upon solving for \\(N\\), \\[ N=\\frac{\\left(9 a_{0}+a_{2}\\right) \\cdot 10^{n-1} \\cdot m}{m-1} \\] These equations can be combined to yield \\[ N=a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n}+a_{1} \\cdot 10^{n-1}-a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n-1}+\\frac{\\left(9 a_{0}+a_{1}\\right) \\cdot 10^{n-1}}{m-1} . \\] But, on the other hand, we know that \\(N\\) is an (n+1)-digit number beginning with digits \\(a_{0}\\) and \\(a_{1}\\) : \\[ N=a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n}+a_{1} \\cdot 10^{n-1}+a_{2} \\cdot 10^{n-2}+\\cdots+a_{n} \\text {, } \\] where we may assume that not all the digits \\(a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n}\\) are zero (otherwise the problem leads to investigation of two-digit numbers \\(N\\); see the solution to problem 15). The following inequality must hold: \\[ 0<-a_{0} \\cdot 10^{n-1}+\\frac{\\left(9 a_{0}+a_{1}\\right) \\cdot 10^{n-1}}{m-1}<10^{n-1}, \\] or, equivalently, \\[ a_{0}<\\frac{9 a_{0}+a_{1}}{m-1}<a_{0}+1 . \\] As a consequence, we have the following results. The required numbers \\(N\\) are expressed by (1), where \\(0 \\leqq a_{0} \\leqq 9,0 \\leqq a_{1} \\leqq 9\\). Since \\(N\\) is an integer, and \\(m\\) and \\(m-1\\) are relatively prime, the proper fraction \\(\\frac{9 a_{0}+a_{1}}{m-1}\\) can be written as a terminating decimal. When this is done the possible values of \\(a_{0}, a_{1}\\) and \\(m\\) must satisfy inequalities (2) in addition, it is necessary to add to the possible values of \\(N\\) the two-digit numbers obtained in the solution of problem 15). There now remains only successive investigations of the possible values for \\(a_{0}\\). (1) \\(a_{0}=1\\). Here, inequality (2) yields \\[ \\begin{gathered} 1<\\frac{18}{m-1}, m-1<18 \\\\ \\frac{9}{m-1}<2, m-1>4 \\end{gathered} \\] Applying the \\(m-1\\) successive values \\(5,6,7, \\cdots, 17\\), and selecting, each time the appropriate value of \\(a_{1}\\), we obtain \\[ \\begin{aligned} N= & 108 ; 105 ; 10,125 ; 1125 ; 12,375 ; 135 ; 14,625 \\\\ & 1575 ; 16,875 ; 121 ; 132 ; 143 ; 154 ; 165 ; 176 ; \\\\ & 187 ; 198 ; 1625 ; 195 ; 192 ; 180,625 ; 19,125 \\end{aligned} \\] to each of which we can adjoin an arbitrary number of zeros.

That integer is then \\(10^{m}+X\\), and the new number is \\(10 X+1\\). The condition of the problem yields \\[ \\left(10^{m}+X\\right) \\cdot 3=10 X+1 \\] or \\[ X=\\frac{3 \\cdot 10^{m}-1}{7} \\text {. } \\] The last equation provides a condition for finding \\(X: 3 \\cdot 10^{m}=3000 \\cdots\\) must yield the remainder 1 upon division by 7 . Direct division by 7 shows that the least number of zeros necessary after 3 to produce a remainder of 1 is 5 ; that is, \\(3 \\cdot 10^{s}=300,000=7(42,857)+1\\). Thus, the least possible value for the integer \\(X\\) is 42,857 , and hence the number sought is 142,857 . To find other such numbers, we note that in dividing \\(3000 \\cdots\\) by 7 we need not stop at the first remainder 1; any quotient obtained for the remainder 1 will serve as an \\(X\\). It is readily seen that the other numbers will be ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_26_a05473b927f418828747g-103.jpg?height=136&width=936&top_left_y=1854&top_left_x=337) Second solution. Let \\(x\\) be the second digit of the number sought, let \\(y\\) be the third digit, and so on; that is, the number has the form \\(\\overline{1 x y \\cdots z t}\\) (the over bar denotes a succession of digits rather than a product). The condition of the problem states \\[ \\overline{1 x y \\cdots z t} \\cdot 3=\\overline{x y \\cdots z t 1} . \\] It is at once apparent that \\(t=7\\) (in no other case will the product on the left yield a final digit 1). Therefore, the tens digit \\(t\\) on the right is 7 . But this is possible only if \\(z \\cdot 3\\) ends in \\(7-2=5(3 \\cdot z\\) plus a carry-over of 2 must yield 7 ); that is, \\(z=5\\). There is a carry-over of 1 . The product, 3 times the hundreds digit on the left, plus the 1 carried over, must yield 5 ; and so on. The reader can readily make up an organized format for this process. For example, \\[ \\begin{aligned} & \\begin{array}{lllllll} 1 & 4 & 2 & 8 & 5 & 7 & 42857 \\end{array} \\\\ & 4-1=3,2-0=2,8-2=6,5-1=4,7-2=5 \\end{aligned} \\] (the calculations are made from right to left). The smallest possible number occurs when we reach the digit 1 on the left, 142,857 . If this process is continued, we obtain other numbers satisfying the conditions by stopping whenever we have adjoined another 1 on the left: \\[ \\cdots ; \\underbrace{42,857,142,857}_{k \\text { times }} \\cdots 1 \\underbrace{42,857} ; \\cdots . \\] (b) When an integer is tripled, the resulting integer can have the same number of digits only if the initial digit of the first number did not exceed 3 . As we saw in problem (a), the first digit can be 1 . We shall show now that it cannot be 3 . If the first digit of the integer sought is 3 , we see from the required equality \\(\\overline{3 x y \\cdots z} \\cdot 3=\\overline{x y \\cdots z}\\) that its second digit (that is, \\(x\\) ) must be 9 . But 3 times any integer beginning with 39 yields an integer having one more digit. Hence the first digit of any integer meeting the conditions of the problem cannot be 3 . It is left to the reader to show that the numbers sought may begin with the digit 2 . The smallest such number is 285,714 ; all such numbers are of form \\[ \\underbrace{\\underbrace{85,71} 4,285,714 \\cdots 285,714}_{k \\text { times }} \\] The proof is quite similar to that of problem (a).", "hints_and_answers": "(a) The smallest possible number is 142,857 .

This digit then becomes the final digit of the new number, which is not divisible by 5 .

{"problem": "Prove that there does not exist an integer which is doubled when the initial digit is transferred to the end.", "solution": "First solution. Since the number of digits is not increased after multiplication by 2, the first digit of the initial number cannot exceed 4. Since after the transfer of the first digit to the end we have an even number (twice the original number), the first digit must be even; hence it must be either 2 or 4 . Consider now the number \\(X\\) obtained by deleting the first digit of the original number sought. Reasoning as we did for problem 19 (a), we obtain \\[ \\left(2 \\cdot 10^{m}+X\\right) \\cdot 2=10 \\cdot X+2, \\] that is, \\[ X=\\frac{4 \\cdot 10^{m}-2}{8}=\\frac{2 \\cdot 10^{m}-1}{4} \\] or else \\[ \\left(4 \\cdot 10^{m}+X\\right) \\cdot 2=10 \\cdot X+4, \\] that is, \\[ X=\\frac{8 \\cdot 10^{m}-4}{8}=\\frac{2 \\cdot 10^{m}-1}{2} \\] However, both of these formulas are impossible, since they do not yield integers (the numerator is odd for both). Second solution. As in the first solution we conclude that the first digit of the number sought must be either 2 or 4 . We use the notation employed in problem 19 (a). We have \\[ \\overline{2 x y \\cdots z t} \\cdot 2=\\overline{x y \\cdots z t 2} \\] or else \\[ \\overline{4 x y \\cdots z t} \\cdot 2=\\overline{x y \\cdots z t 4} . \\] In the first case, \\(t\\) can be only 1 or 6 (otherwise the product on the left cannot end with the digit 2). But if \\(t=1\\), then on the left is a number not divisible by 4 , and on the right is a number divisible by 4 (an integer being divisible by 4 if and only if the number composed of its last two digits is divisible by 4). If \\(t=6\\), then on the left is a number divisible by 4 (product of two even numbers), but on the right is a number not divisible by 4 (ending in 62). In the second case, \\(t\\) can be only 2 or 7 . If \\(t=2\\), then [as in the second solution of problem 19(a)], necessarily, \\(z=1\\), and it follows that the product on the left is divisible by 8 (product of a number divisible by 4 , since it ends in 12 , and 2 ), but the number on the right is not divisible by 8 (ending in 124). The demonstration for \\(t=7\\) is left to the reader. It is quite similar to the foregoing solutions.", "hints_and_answers": "Try to solve the following problem: Find a number with a given initial digit which is doubled upon transferring the initial digit to the end."}
{"problem": "(a) Prove that there does not exist an integer which becomes either seven times or nine times as great when the initial digit is transferred to the end. (b) Prove that no integer becomes four times as great when its initial digit is transferred to the end.", "solution": "(a) First solution. A number increased seven-fold upon transfer of its first digit to the end must commence with the digit 1 (otherwise the larger number would contain more digits than the original). As was done in problem 19 (a), we let \\(X\\) be the \\(m\\)-digit integer obtained by deleting the first digit, 1 , of the number sought. Then, as in the previous problems, \\[ \\left(1 \\cdot 10^{m}+X\\right) \\cdot 7=10 \\cdot X+1, \\] which yields \\[ X=\\frac{7 \\cdot 10^{m}-1}{3} \\] But it is obvious that there is no \\(m\\) for which \\(X\\) can be an \\(m\\)-digit number \\(\\left(\\frac{7 \\cdot 10^{m}-1}{3}>10^{m}\\right)\\). A similar demostration will prove that there is no number which is increased nine-fold by transfer of its initial digit to the end of the number. Second solution. We conclude, as in the first solution, that the number sought must begin with the digit 1 . Using the terminology explained in problem 19 (b), we have the following statement of our problem: \\[ \\overline{1 x y \\cdots z t} \\cdot 7=\\overline{x y \\cdots z t 1} . \\] It follows that the product \\(t \\cdot 7\\) must end with the digit 1 , which requires that \\(t=3\\). Insertion of this digit for \\(t\\) yields \\(\\overline{1 y \\cdots z 3} \\cdot 7=\\overline{y \\cdots z 31}\\). Since \\(3 \\cdot 7=21\\), and the product of of \\(\\overline{z 3}\\) by 7 ends in the succession of digits 31 , this product has 1 as a final digit. Consequently, \\(z\\) is also equal to 3 . A similar procedure shows that each successive digit (from this end forward) is equal to 3 . However, the initial digit of the number must be 1 , which is impossible. Therefore, there does not exist any integer which increases sevenfold upon transfer of its first digit to the end. (b) First solution. Inasmuch as the number to be obtained upon multiplying the sought integer by 4 must not contain a greater number of digits than before, the initial digit cannot exceed 2 . Since transfer of the initial digit to the end must produce an even num- ber, that digit must be 2 . If now we designate by \\(X\\) the \\(m\\)-digit number obtained from the number sought, upon removing the first digit we obtain \\[ \\left(2 \\cdot 10^{m}+X\\right) \\cdot 4=10 X+2, \\] or \\[ X=\\frac{8 \\cdot 10^{m}-2}{6} \\] which is an impossibility, since \\(\\frac{8 \\cdot 10^{m}-2}{6}>10^{m}\\) [see the first solution of problem (a)]. Second solution. As in the first solution, the first digit of the number sought must be 2. Moreover, \\[ \\overline{2 x y \\cdots z t} \\cdot 4=\\overline{x y \\cdots z t 2} \\text {, } \\] and it follows that \\(t=3\\) or 8 ( \\(t \\cdot 4\\) ends in 2 ). If \\(t=8\\), then the final two digits on the right form the number 82 , and the integer is not divisible by 4 . If \\(t=3\\), then \\[ \\overline{2 x y \\cdots z 3} \\cdot 4=\\overline{x y \\cdots z 32}, \\] hence \\[ \\overline{2 x y \\cdots z 0} \\cdot 4=\\overline{x y \\cdots z 20}, \\] and \\[ \\overline{2 x y \\cdots z} \\cdot 4=\\overline{x y \\cdots z 2} . \\] In the same manner we find that the number \\(\\overline{2 x y \\cdots z}\\) has the same property as did \\(\\overline{2 x y \\cdots z t}\\). By applying the same reasoning as before we find that, necessarily, \\(z=3\\). Continuing this line of reasoning, and moving from right to left, we find that the tens position of the number must have the digit 3. But the initial number must commence with the digit 2 . This is obviously impossible.", "hints_and_answers": "This solution is analogous to that of problem 21."}
{"problem": "Find the least integer whose first digit is seven and which is reduced to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) its original value when its first digit is tranferred to the end. Find all such integers.", "solution": "First solution. Let us designate the digits of the integer sought by \\(x, y, \\cdots, z, t\\). Then proceeding as in problem 19 (a), we obtain \\[ \\overline{7 x y \\cdots z t} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}=\\overline{x y \\cdots z t 7} \\] or \\[ \\overline{x y \\cdot z t 7} \\cdot 3=\\overline{7 x y \\cdots z t} . \\] It is clear that \\(t=1\\); we can determine the digit \\(z(17 \\cdot 3\\) yields 51 ; this means that \\(z=5\\) ), and, moving from right to left we obtain, successively, the digits forming the integer sought. The process ends when we obtain the digit 7 . It is convenient to display the result in the following form: 241379310344827586206896551 7241379310344827586206896551 (the calculations are made from right to left). Thus, the least integer satisfying the conditions of the problem is \\(7,241,379,310,344,827,586\\), \\(206,896,551\\). If in the course of these calculations we do not stop when we first obtain a 7 , we can find additional numbers which satisfy the conditions of the problem. All such numbers will be of the form ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_26_a05473b927f418828747g-108.jpg?height=150&width=1159&top_left_y=899&top_left_x=226) Second solution. Let \\(\\overline{7 x y z \\cdots t}\\) be the integer sought. Division by 3 must yield the integer \\(\\overline{x y z \\cdots t 7}\\). We write this requirement in the form \\[ \\overline{7 x y z \\cdots t} \\frac{\\mid 3}{\\overline{x y z \\cdots t 7}} \\] It is clear that \\(x=2\\) is necessary. If we replace \\(x\\) by 2 in the dividend and quotient, we can find the next digit of the quotient, and this is also the third digit of the dividend; we can then determine the third digit of the quotient, which is the fourth digit of the dividend, and so on. The process is complete when the final digit of the quotient is 7 and simultaneously the dividend is exactly divisible by 3 . This dividend is then the number sought and is the least integer having the required property. The following arrangement is a convenient scheme for carrying out this computation (the numbers in the second row are written last): \\[ \\begin{aligned} & \\begin{array}{lllllllllllllllllll} 7 & 2 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 7 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 2 & 7 & 5 & 8 & 6 \\end{array} \\\\ & \\begin{array}{lllllllllllllllllll} 7 & 12 & 4 & 11 & 23 & 27 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 10 & 13 & 14 & 24 & 8 & 22 & 17 & 25 & 18 & 6 \\end{array} \\\\ & \\begin{array}{lllllllllllllllllllll} 2 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 7 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 3 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 2 & 7 & 5 & 8 & 6 & 2 & 0 \\end{array} \\\\ & \\begin{array}{llllllll} 0 & 6 & 8 & 9 & 6 & 5 & 5 & 1 \\end{array} \\end{aligned} \\] ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_26_a05473b927f418828747g-108.jpg?height=47&width=424&top_left_y=2104&top_left_x=949) \\[ \\begin{aligned} & \\begin{array}{llllllll} 6 & 8 & 9 & 6 & 5 & 5 & 1 & 7 \\end{array} \\end{aligned} \\] The least integer is found to be \\(7,241,379,310,344,827,586,206,896,551\\). Third solution. As in the first solution of problem 19 (a), set up the formula \\[ \\left(7 \\cdot 10^{m}+X\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}=10 X+7 \\] from which \\[ X=\\frac{7 \\cdot 10^{m}-21}{29} \\] The problem then becomes that of finding an integer of form \\(70,000, \\cdots\\) which upon division by 29 yields the remainder 21 . It is left to the reader to verify that the same solution is obtained as before. Remark: A similar algorithm may be employed to solve the following generalized problem: Find the least integer having a given first digit which is diminished to \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) its original size when the first digit is transferred to the end. To make the solution possible for integers having 1 or 2 as a first digit, let us agree that a zero may be put as the first digit of the quotient (and this is then the second digit of the dividend). The only nonzero integers satisfying the requirements are (in addition to that produced above): \\[ \\begin{aligned} & 1,034,482,758,620,689,655,172,413,793 ; \\\\ & 2,068,965,517,241,379,310,344,827,586 ; \\\\ & 3,103,448,275,862,068,965,517,241,379 ; \\\\ & 4,137,931,034,482,758,620,689,655,172 ; \\\\ & 5,172,413,793,103,448,275,862,068,965 ; \\\\ & 6,206,896,551,724,137,931,034,482,758 ; \\\\ & 8,275,862,068,965,517,241,379,310,344 ; \\\\ & 9,310,344,827,586,206,896,551,724,137 \\end{aligned} \\] The same procedure will solve the following problem: Find the least integer commencing with a given digit \\(a\\) which is decreased by a factor \\(l\\) when the first digit is transferred to the end.", "hints_and_answers": "The smallest number satisfying the conditions of the problem is \\(7,241,379,310,344,827,586,206,896,551\\)."}

Prove that there exists no natural number whose inversion is two, three, five, seven, or eight times that number. (b) Find all integers whose inversions are four or nine times the original number.", "solution": "(a) The conditions of the problem may be expressed by the equality \\[ \\overline{x y \\cdots z t} \\cdot a=\\overline{t z \\cdots y x}, \\] where \\(a\\) is one of the numbers \\(2,3,5,6,7\\) or 8 . If \\(a=5\\), then \\(x\\) must be 1; otherwise the number on the right will contain one digit too many. (The case in which \\(x\\) is 0 may be excluded, since upon multiplying each side by 2 and deleting the final zero we obtain \\(\\overline{y \\cdots z t}=2 \\cdot \\overline{t z \\cdots y}\\); that is, we arrive at the same problem as for \\(a=2\\).) But the integer \\(\\overline{t z \\cdots y 1}\\) is not divisible by 5 . Analogous reasoning will prove that \\(a\\) cannot be 6 or 8 . If \\(a=7\\), then \\(x\\) again must be 1 . In this case, \\(t\\) must be the digit 3 , otherwise \\(\\overline{1 y \\cdots z t} \\cdot 7\\) fails to end with the digit 1 . But the equation \\(\\overline{1 y \\cdots z 3} \\cdot 7=\\overline{3 z \\cdots y 1}\\) is clearly impossible, since the left number is greater than the right number. If \\(a=2\\), then \\(x\\) cannot exceed 4 . Since the integer \\(\\overline{t z \\cdots y x}\\) must be even, \\(x\\) is either 2 or 4 . If \\(x=4\\), the digit \\(t\\) (the first digit of \\(\\overline{4 y \\cdots z t} \\cdot 2\\) ) can be only 8 or 9 , and neither \\(\\overline{4 y \\cdots z 8} \\cdot 2\\) nor \\(\\overline{4 y \\cdots z 9} \\cdot 2\\) ends with the digit 4 . If \\(x=2\\), then \\(t\\) (the first digit of \\(\\overline{2 y \\cdots z t} \\cdot 2\\) ) can only be 4 or 5 ; but neither \\(\\overline{2 y \\cdots z 4} \\cdot 2\\) nor \\(\\overline{2 y \\cdots z 5} \\cdot 2\\) can end in 2. Finally, if \\(z=3\\), then \\(x\\) cannot exceed 3 . If \\(x=1\\), then \\(t\\) must be \\(7(t \\cdot 3\\) ends in 1 ); if \\(x=2\\), then \\(t\\) must be 4 ; if \\(x=3\\), then \\(t\\) must be 1 . But in the first case, \\(\\overline{t z \\cdots y x}\\) is certainly greater than \\(\\overline{x y \\cdots z t} \\cdot 3\\), and in the second and their cases it is clearly smaller. (b) Let \\(x y \\cdots z t\\) be an integer which is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) its inversion. We then have \\[ \\overline{x y \\cdots z t} \\cdot 4=\\overline{t z \\cdots y x} . \\] Since \\(\\overline{x y \\cdots z t} \\cdot 4\\) is to contain the same number of digits as does \\(\\overline{x y \\cdots z t}\\), the digit \\(x\\) can be only 0,1 , or 2 . Since \\(\\overline{t z \\cdots y x}\\) must be divisible by 4 , it follows that \\(x\\) must be even, and so the only possibilities are \\(x=0\\) (if we allow 0 to be counted as a digit at the beginning of the integer), or \\(x=2\\). Suppose \\(x=0\\). Then \\(t=0\\) or else \\(t=5\\). Write \\(\\overline{o y \\cdots y t} \\cdot 4=\\) \\(\\overline{t z \\cdots y}\\); we note that \\(t\\) cannot be the digit 5 (regardless what digit \\(y\\) is), and so the only possibility is \\(t=0\\). We can now write \\(\\overline{y \\cdots z} \\cdot 4=\\) \\(\\overline{z \\cdots y}\\); that is, if a number meeting the condition of the problem begins with 0 , then it also ends in 0 , and the integer obtained by deleting these two zeros will also meet the conditions of the problem. It suffices therefore to investigate \\(x=2\\), for which \\(\\overline{2 y \\cdots z t} \\cdot 4=\\) \\(\\overline{t z \\cdots y 2}\\). Since \\(2 \\cdot 4=8, t\\) can be only 8 or 9 , but \\(t=9\\) can immediately be eliminated as a possibility. Thus, \\(t=8\\), and we can write \\(\\overline{2 y \\cdots z 8} \\cdot 4=\\overline{8 z \\cdots y 2}\\). Since \\(23 \\cdot 4>90, y\\) can be only 0,1 , or 2 ; also, the tens digit of any product of form \\(\\overline{z 8} \\cdot 4\\) must be odd. Thus, \\(y=1\\). Since we know the final two digits (12) in the product \\(\\overline{21 \\cdots z 8} \\cdot 4\\), we can easily find the only two possibilities for the next successive digit: \\(z\\) can be only 2 or 7 . But \\(21 \\cdot 4>82\\), which means that \\(z=7\\). Hence, the number must have the form \\(\\overline{21 \\cdots 78}\\). We note that the integer 2178 satisfies the condition of the problem, and hence it is the only such four-digit number. We now consider solutions in terms of integers having more than four digits. We must have \\[ \\overline{21 u v \\cdots r s 78} \\cdot 4=\\overline{87 s r \\cdots v u 12}, \\] which may be written \\[ \\begin{aligned} & 84 \\cdot 10^{k \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2}+312+\\overline{u v \\cdots r s 00 \\cdot 4} \\\\ & \\quad=87 \\cdot 10^{k \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2}+12+\\overline{s r \\cdots v u 00}, \\end{aligned} \\] or \\[ \\overline{u v \\cdots r s} \\cdot 4+3=\\overline{3 s r \\cdots v u} . \\] Since when the number \\(u v \\cdots r s\\) is multiplied by 4 , and 3 is added, the digit 3 is produced as the leading digit of the resulting calculation, the digit \\(u\\) must be at least as great as 6 , but since \\(\\overline{3 s r \\cdots v u}\\) must be odd, the only possibilities are 9 or 7 . We shall investigate both possibilities. When \\(u=9\\) we have \\[ \\overline{9 v \\cdots r s} \\cdot 4+3=\\overline{3 s r \\cdots v 9}, \\] from which it follows that \\(s=9(s \\cdot 4\\) must terminate in 6 ; if \\(s=4\\), then \\(\\overline{34 r \\cdots v 9}\\) is smaller than \\(\\left.\\overline{y_{v} \\cdots r 4} \\cdot 4+3\\right)\\), and so \\[ \\overline{9 v \\cdots r 9} \\cdot 4+3=\\overline{39 r \\cdots v 9} . \\] That is (for \\(u=9\\) ), in order for \\(\\overline{21 u v \\cdots r s 78}\\) to meet the conditions of the problem, the final digit of \\(\\overline{u v \\cdots r s}\\) must also be 9 . In particular, \\(\\overline{u v \\cdots r s}\\) must be \\(9,99,999\\), and so on. We obtain the numbers \\[ 21,978 ; 219,978 ; 2199 ; 978 ; \\cdots \\text {. } \\] We can easily verify that all such numbers satisfy the conditions of the problem. When \\(u=7\\) we have \\[ \\overline{7 v \\cdots r s} \\cdot 4+3=\\overline{3 s r \\cdots v 7} . \\] Reasoning as we did initially in this problem, we find that \\(s=1\\), \\(v=8, r=2\\); that is, the digit sequence \\(\\overline{u v \\cdots r s}\\) must have the form \\(\\overline{78 \\cdots 21}\\). We can easily verify that if the digit pairs 78 and 21 are inserted between 21 as the first digit pair, and 78 as the last digit pair, the resulting integer satisfies the conditions of the problem: For example, \\[ 217821782178 \\cdot 4=871287128712 . \\] But according to the treatment for \\(u=9\\) we will also obtain solutions if we insert the digit 9 in the appropriate positions. For example, the following numbers are solutions: \\[ \\begin{aligned} & 0 ; 2178 ; 21,978 ; 219,978 ; \\cdots, \\\\ & 2199 \\underbrace{\\cdots}_{k \\text { times }} 978,2199 \\underbrace{\\ldots 9978}_{(k+1) \\text { times }}, \\cdots . \\end{aligned} \\] The insertion of the digit 9 may be made after any sequence \\(\\overline{2} \\overline{1}\\), provided it is also made in the equivalent location counted from the other end of the number. Thus, any sequential array of digits of the form \\[ P_{1} P_{2} \\cdots P_{n-1} P_{n} P_{n-1} \\cdots P_{2} P_{1} \\] where each letter \\(P_{i}\\) is one of the numbers from the display (1).

It may be proven in an analogous way that all integers which are increased by a factor of 9 upon reversal of the digits can be obtained by sequentially placing together integers of the form \\[ 0 ; 1089 ; 10,989 ; 109,989 ; \\cdots ; 1099 \\underbrace{\\cdots}_{k \\text { times }} 989 ; 1099 \\underbrace{\\cdots+1) \\text { times }} 9989 ; \\cdots \\] in the same fashion as done for (1).", "hints_and_answers": "(a) A number whose inversion exceeds it by a factor of 5,6 , 7 , or 8 must necessarily have 1 as its first digit; a number whose inversion exceeds it by a factor of 2 or 3 can begin only with digits \\(1,2,3,4\\), or, respectively, 1,2 , or 3 .

{"problem": "Find a six-digit number whose product by \\(2,3,4,5\\), or 6 contains the same digits as did the original number (in different order, of course).", "solution": "Let \\(x\\) be a number satisfying the condition of the problem. Since \\(6 x\\) must be, along with \\(x\\), a six-digit integer, the first digit of \\(x\\) must be 1 (and the following digit cannot exceed 6). Hence: (1) The leading digits of the numbers \\(x, 2 x, 3 x, 4 x, 5 x\\), and \\(6 x\\) are all different and, as a result, must comprise all the digits contained in the integer \\(x\\) (each of these digits must appear in the original number \\(x\\) ). (2) All the digits of \\(x\\) are different. None of these digits is 0(otherwise one of the above products starts with 0 ), and so the final digit of \\(x\\) must be odd (otherwise \\(5 x\\) ends with an 0 ); also, the final digit must differ from 5 (otherwise \\(2 x\\) ends in 0\\()\\). Consequently, the final digits of the numbers \\(x, 2 x, 3 x, 4 x, 5 x\\), and \\(6 x\\) are all different, which implies that these digits comprise all the digits appearing in \\(x\\). Therefore, one of these final digits is 1 . Since only the number \\(3 x\\) can terminate with a \\(1(2 x, 4 x, 6 x\\) being even, \\(5 x\\) having 5 as a final digit, and \\(x\\) itself already having 1 as its first digit), it follows that \\(x\\) must end with the digit \\(7 ; 2 x\\) ends with the digit \\(4 ; 3 x\\) ends with the digit \\(1 ; 4 x\\) ends with the digit 8 ; \\(5 x\\) ends with the digit 5 ; and \\(6 x\\) ends with the digit 2 . Now, the first digits of these numbers are the individual digits of the digit set comprising \\(x\\); we display them in increasing order, using (asterisks to represent unknown digits): \\[ \\begin{aligned} & x \\cdot 1=1 * * * * 7, \\\\ & x \\cdot 2=2 * * * * 4, \\\\ & x \\cdot 3=4 * * * * 1, \\end{aligned} \\] \\[ \\begin{aligned} & x \\cdot 4=5 * * * * 8, \\\\ & x \\cdot 5=7 * * * * 5, \\\\ & x \\cdot 6=8 * * * * 2 . \\end{aligned} \\] In this display, not only must each row contain (on the right) all six distinct digits \\(1,2,4,5,7\\), and 8 , but each column must contain these six distinct digits, in some order. Suppose that \\(x \\cdot 2\\) and \\(x \\cdot 5\\) have the same digit \\(a\\) in a certain position, say in the third position ( \\(a\\) can have only one of the two values not assumed by either the first or the last digit of either of the two investigated numbers). Since the difference \\(x \\cdot 5-x \\cdot 2=x \\cdot 3\\) will be a six-digit number, either the digit 0 or the digit 9 will stand in its third position (since we can take, at most, a unit carry-over into this place for the subtraction). But this is an impossibility, since we already know that the number \\(x \\cdot 3\\) will contain neither an 0 nor a 9 as one of its digits.

Any odd power of 9 can be written as \\(9^{2 n+1}=9 \\cdot 81^{n}\\) and therefore ends with the digit 9 . Since \\(9^{\\left(9^{9}\\right)}\\) is an odd power of 9 , it must end with the digit 9 . It is obvious that \\(16^{n}\\) ends with the digit 6 for all \\(n \\geqq 1\\).

(b) If we find the remainder yielded upon division of \\(2^{999}\\) by 100 , it will be the number formed by the two final digits of \\(2^{999}\\). We first show, that the number \\(2^{1000}\\) yields the remainder 1 upon division by 25. In fact, \\(2^{10}+1=1024+1=1025\\) is divisible by 25 ; and so \\(2^{20}-1=\\left(2^{10}+1\\right)\\left(2^{10}-1\\right)\\) is divisible by 25 . Thus, \\(2^{1000}-1=\\left(2^{20}\\right)^{50}-1\\), being divisible by \\(2^{20}-1\\), is also divisible by 25 , and so upon division by 25 the number \\(2^{1000}\\) yields the remainder 1 . It follows that the final two digits of \\(2^{1000}\\) can be only 01 , or \\(01+25=26\\), or \\(01+50=51\\), or \\(01+75=76\\). Since \\(2^{1000}\\) is divisible by 4 , the only possibility among these four numbers is 76 . Thus, \\(2^{999}\\) is the quotient obtained by dividing an integer ending in 76 by 2 . The only possibilities are 38 and 88 . Since \\(2^{999}\\) is divisible by 4 , there remains the one possibility, 88 , for the final two digits. As above, we investigate the remainder obtained upon dividing \\(3^{999}\\) by 100 . We recall that every even power of 9 ends with the digit 1 and that every odd power ends with the digit 9 [see the solution to problem (a)]. Now consider the remainder obtained upon division of \\(9^{5}+1\\) by 100 . We have \\[ \\begin{aligned} 9^{5}+1 & =(9+1) \\cdot\\left(9^{4}-9^{3}+9^{2}-9+1\\right) \\\\ & =10 \\cdot\\left(9^{4}-9^{3}+9^{2}-9+1\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] The numbers \\(9^{4}, 9^{2}\\), and 1 all end with the digit 1 , and the numbers \\(9^{3}\\) and 9 end with 9 . Thus, \\(9^{4}+9^{2}+1\\) ends with 3 , and \\(9^{3}+9\\) ends with 8 , which means that the number \\(9^{4}-9^{3}+9^{2}-9+1\\) must end with 5 . Accordingly, \\(9^{5}+1\\) must yield upon division by 100 the remainder \\(10 \\cdot 5=50\\). It follows that \\(9^{10}-1=\\left(9^{5}+1\\right) \\cdot\\left(9^{5}-1\\right)\\) is divisible by 100 , and since \\(3^{1000}-1=9^{500}-1=\\left(9^{10}\\right)^{50}-1\\) is divisible by \\(9^{10}-1\\), it follows that \\(3^{1000}-1\\) is divisible by 100 . Thus, \\(3^{1000}\\) ends with the digits 01 . But this number is, of course, divisible by 3 ; consequently, the carry-over from the hundreds place of \\(3^{1000}\\) to the tens place must be 2 (if it were 0 or 1 , then \\(3^{1000}\\) would not be divisible by 3 ). Therefore, the number \\(3^{999}=3^{1000} / 3\\) must end with the same two digits as the number \\(201 / 3=67\\). (c) We must find the remainder, upon division by 100, of the number \\(14^{\\left(14^{14)}\\right.}=(7 \\cdot 2)^{\\left(14^{144}\\right)}\\). First we find the remainders, upon division by 100 , of \\(7^{\\left(14^{14}\\right)}\\) and \\(2\\left({ }^{11^{14}}\\right)\\). The number \\(7^{4}-1=2401-1=2400\\) is divisible by 100 . It follows that if \\(n=4 k\\) ( \\(k\\) being an integer), then \\(7^{n}-1\\) is divisible by 100 (since \\(7^{4 k}-1=\\left(7^{4}\\right)^{k}-1^{k}\\) is divisible by \\(7^{4}-1\\) ). Now, \\(14^{14}=2^{14} \\cdot 7^{14}\\) is divisible by 4 ; consequently, \\(7^{\\left(14^{14}\\right)}-1\\) is divisible by 100 , which means that \\(7^{\\left(11^{14}\\right)}\\) ends with the digits 01 . In the solution of part (b) it was shown that \\(2^{20}-1\\) is divisible by 25 ; hence, if \\(n=20 k\\), then \\(2^{n}-1\\) is divisible by 25 . We will now find the remainder obtained from division of \\(14^{14}\\) by 20 . Clearly, \\(14^{14}=2^{14} \\cdot 7^{14}\\). But \\(2^{14}=4 \\cdot 2^{12}\\). Since \\(2^{12}-1=\\left(2^{4}\\right)^{3}-1\\) is divisible by \\(2^{4}-1=16-1=15\\), it follows that \\(4\\left(2^{12}-1\\right)\\) is divisible by 20 , and consequently \\(2^{14}=4 \\cdot 2^{12}\\) yields upon division by 20 a remainder of 4. Further, \\(7^{14}=49 \\cdot 7^{12}\\). Since \\(7^{12}\\) yields a remainder of 1 upon division by 20 (12 is divisible by 4 , whence \\(7^{12}-1\\) is divisible by 100 ), it follows that \\(49.7^{12}\\) yields upon division by 20 the same remainder as does 49 , that is, 9 . Similarly, \\(14^{14}=2^{14} \\cdot 7^{14}\\) yields upon division by 20 the same remainder as does the product \\(4 \\cdot 9=36\\), that is, 16 ; or \\(14^{14}=20 k+16\\). It follows that \\(2^{\\left(14^{14)}\\right.}=2^{16} \\cdot 2^{20 k}\\) yields upon division by 25 the same remainder as does \\(2^{16}=65,536\\); that is, \\(2^{\\left(14^{14}\\right)}\\) can end only with one of the numbers \\(11,36,61\\), or 86 . Since \\(2^{\\left(14^{14}\\right)}\\) is divisible by 4 , the final two digits must be 36 . Therefore, since \\(7^{\\left(14^{14}\\right)}\\) ends with the digits 01 , and \\(2^{\\left(14^{14}\\right)}\\) has as its two final digits 36 , the product \\(7^{\\left(11^{14}\\right)} \\cdot 2^{\\left(11^{14}\\right)}=14^{\\left(14^{14}\\right)}\\) ends with 36 .", "hints_and_answers": "(a) \\(9 ; 2\\).

What are the final two digits of this number?", "solution": "(a) We make use of the fact that the product of two numbers ending respectively with the digits \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will have the same final digit as does the product \\(a \\cdot b\\). This provides a simple solution for the problem. We consider successively greater powers of 7 , keeping track of the final digit only: \\(7^{2}\\) ends with the digit \\(9 ; 7^{3}=7 \\cdot 7^{2}\\) with the digit \\(3 ; 7^{4}=7 \\cdot 7^{3}\\) with the digit 1 ; and \\(7^{7}=7^{4} \\cdot 7^{3}\\) with the digit 3 . Moreover, we find that \\(\\left(7^{7}\\right)^{7}\\) ends with the digit \\(7\\left[\\left(7^{7}\\right)^{2}\\right.\\) ends with 9 ; \\(\\left(7^{7}\\right)^{3}\\) ends with 7 ; \\(\\left(7^{7}\\right)^{4}\\) ends with 1 , and, finally, \\(\\left(7^{7}\\right)^{7}\\) ends with 7 ]. We find, at the next stage, that the number \\(\\left(\\left(7^{7}\\right)^{7}\\right)^{7}\\) ends with the same digit as does \\(7^{7}\\) (the digit 3 ), and the number \\(\\left(\\left(\\left(7^{7}\\right)^{7}\\right)^{7}\\right)^{7}\\) ends again with the digit 7 , and so on. Continuation of this process must then yield the following rule. For an odd number of exponents 7 we obtain a final digit 3 , and for an even number of exponents we obtain a final digit 7 . Since 1000 is an even integer, the number sought has 7 as its final digit. If an integer ends with a two-digit number \\(A\\), and another integer ends with a two-digit number \\(B\\), then the product of the two integers ends with the same two-dight number as does the product \\(A \\cdot B\\). This fact allows us to find the final two digits for the number mentioned by the problem. We easily verify, by the methods used above, that \\(7^{7}\\) ends with the two-digit number 43 , and \\(\\left(7^{7}\\right)^{7}\\) ends with the same two digits as does \\(43^{7}\\), namely 07 . It follows that in taking successive 7 th powers, \\(7,7^{7},\\left(7^{7}\\right)^{7}, \\cdots\\), we obtain for an odd number of such \"raises\" a number with final digits 43 , and for an even number a number with final digits 07 . Therefore, the number in which we are interested must end with 07. (b) In the solution of problem (a) we saw that \\(7^{4}\\) ends with the digit 1. Therefore, \\(7^{4 k}=\\left(7^{4}\\right)^{k}\\) also ends with the dight 1 , and \\(7^{4 k+r}\\), where \\(k\\) is one of the numbers \\(0,1,2\\), or 3 , ends with the same digit as does \\(7^{r}\\) (since \\(7^{4 k+r}=7^{4 k} \\cdot 7^{r}\\) ). Thus, the problem reduces to finding the remainder, modulo 4 (that is, after division by 4), of the \"exponential part\" of the given number. The power to which 7 is raised is again a power of 7 . We must determine the remainder obtained by dividing the latter power by 4 .

This is possible only if the final digit of \\(n^{2}\\) is 8 or 3 , and no square of an integer ends in either of these digits. (b) Of three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3 , another yields a remainder of 1 upon division by 3 , and the third yields remainder of 2 (or, equivalently, a remainder of -1 ). Upon multiplication of two such integers, the remainders obtained from division by any number are also multiplied; actually, \\[ (p k+r)(q k+s)=p q k^{2}+p k s+q k r+r s=k(p q k+p s+q r)+r s . \\] Hence, if a number yields the remainder 1 upon division by 3 , then all of its powers yield the remainder 1 upon division by 3 ; if the remainder is -1 , then all of the odd powers of the number will yield the remainder -1 , and the even powers will yield the remainder 1. Thus, given three even powers of consecutive integers, we have, upon division by 3 , the remainder 0 for one power and the remainder 1 for the other two. Therefore, the sum of even powers of three consective integers yields the remainder 2 when divided by 3 (or, equivalently, the remainder -1); but no even power of any integer, as we have just shown, can yield this remainder upon division by 3 . Remark: The even powers referred to in problem (b) need not be the same. In problem (c) note that the even powers referred to are all the same. (c) As we saw in the solution of problem (a), the sum of even powers of three consecutive integers yields a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 . It follows that the sum of even powers of nine consecutive numbers yield a \"remainder\" of 6 upon division by 3 , that is, this sum is divisible by 3 . We must show that such a sum (wherein the even powers are the same) is not divisible by \\(3^{2}=9\\). Of nine consective integers, one is divisible by 9 , and the others yield remainders from 1 to 8 . If \\(2 k\\) is the (even) power to which the nine consecutive integers are raised, then the sum yields the same remainder upon division by 9 as does \\[ 0+1^{2 k}+2^{2 k}+3^{2 k}+4^{2 k}+5^{2 k}+6^{2 k}+7^{2 k}+8^{2 k} \\] or the sum \\[ 2\\left(1^{k}+4^{k}+7^{k}\\right) \\] (since \\(3^{2}\\) and \\(6^{2}\\) are divisible by \\(9 ; 1^{2}\\) and \\(8^{2}=64\\) each yield a remainder \\(1 ; 2^{2}=4\\) and \\(7^{2}=49\\) yield remainders of \\(4 ; 4^{2}=16\\) and \\(5^{2}=25\\) yield remainders of 7 ).

It follows that both numbers yield a remainder of 1 upon division by 9 (an integer yields the same remainder upon division by 9 as does the sum of its digits). But if \\(A / B=n\\), or \\(A=n B\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer different from 1 , then, since \\(B=\\) \\(9 N+1\\), it follows from \\(A=n B=9 M+n\\) that \\(n\\) must yield a remainder of 1 upon division by 9 . The least value which \\(n\\) can assume is 10. However, \\(A / B<10\\), inasmuch as \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are both seven-digit numbers. (b) Designate the integers sought by \\(N, 2 N, 3 N\\). Since an integer yields the same remainder upon division by 9 as does the sum of its digits, the sum \\(N+2 N+3 N\\) must yield the same remainder upon division by 9 as does \\(1+2+3+\\cdots+9=45\\) in order to meet the condition imposed by the problem. Hence, \\(6 N\\) (and consequently \\(3 N)\\) is divisible by 9 . Since \\(3 N\\) is to be a three-digit number, the first digit of \\(N\\) cannot exceed 3. It follows that the last digit of \\(N\\) cannot be 1 , since the integer \\(2 N\\) would end with 2 and \\(3 N\\) would end with 3 , and then none of these three digits is available to begin \\(N\\). The integer \\(N\\) cannot terminate with 5 , since \\(2 N\\) would end with 0 .

{"problem": "Which integers can have squares that end with four identical digits?", "solution": "A perfect square can terminate in only one of the digits \\(0,1,4,9,6\\), or 5 . Moreover, the square of an even integer is obviously divisible by 4 , and the square of an odd integer yields the remainder 1 upon division by 4 [since \\((2 k+1)^{2}=4\\left(k^{2}+k\\right)+1\\) ]. Hence, no square can end with any of the pairs \\(11,99,66\\), or 55 , since numbers ending in the digits \\(11,99,66\\), or 55 yield upon division by 4 the respective remainders \\(3,3,2\\), and 3 ). We now investigate which remainders are possible when a perfect square is divided by 16 . Every integer can be represented in one of the following forms: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} 8 k, & 8 k \\pm 3, \\\\ 8 k \\pm 1, & 8 k \\pm 4 . \\\\ 8 k \\pm 2, & \\end{array} \\] The squares of these numbers have the following forms: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} 16\\left(4 k^{2}\\right), & 16\\left(4 k^{2} \\pm 3 k\\right)+9, \\\\ 16\\left(4 k^{2} \\pm k\\right)+1, & 16\\left(4 k^{2} \\pm 4 k+1\\right) . \\\\ 16\\left(4 k^{2} \\pm 2 k\\right)+4, & \\end{array} \\] These forms show that the square of an integer is either divisible by 16 or will yield a remainder of 1,4 , or 9 when divided by 16 . The possibility of ending with 1 or 9 has been excluded. A number ending with the succession of digits 4444 yields a remainder of 12 upon division by 16 and therefore must also be eliminated as a possibility for a perfect square.

It follows immediately from the formula just obtained that if \\(n=m b\\) (that is, if \\(n\\) is a multiple of \\(b\\) ), then the number \\(N\\) is not less than \\(N^{\\prime}\\). The numbers \\(n_{0}^{\\prime}, n_{1}^{\\prime}, \\cdots, n_{b-1}^{\\prime}\\) are all equal to \\(m\\), and consequently the sum of the squares of the pairwise differences of the numbers vanishes. It is less obvious that if \\(n\\) yields the remainder \\(r \\neq 0\\) upon division by \\(b\\) (that is, \\(n=m b+r, 0<r<b\\) ), we obtain the inequality \\(N \\geqq N^{\\prime}\\). Here, \\(r\\) of the numbers \\(n_{0}^{\\prime}, n_{1}^{\\prime}, \\cdots, n_{b-1}^{\\prime}\\) (in par- ticular, the numbers \\(n_{1}^{\\prime}, n_{2}^{\\prime}, \\cdots, n_{r}^{\\prime}\\) ) are equal to \\(m+1\\), and the remaining numbers, \\(n_{0}^{\\prime}, n_{r+1}^{\\prime}, \\cdots, n_{b-1}^{\\prime}\\), are equal to \\(m\\). In order to prove that \\(N\\) cannot be less than \\(N^{\\prime}\\), we employ the following formal method. Since the sum of the \\(b\\) numbers \\(n_{0}, n_{1}, \\cdots, n_{b-1}\\) is equal to \\(n=\\) \\(m b+r\\), at least one of these numbers, say \\(n_{t}\\), does not exceed \\(m\\) [otherwise the sum of these numbers would be not less than \\(b(m+1)>n]\\). We now add one more number, \\(a_{n+1}\\), to the numbers \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n}-\\) a number giving a remainder of \\(t\\) upon division by \\(b\\). Then the number of differences \\(a_{k}-a_{l}\\) is augmented by the \\(n\\) differences: \\(a_{n+1}-a_{1}, a_{n+1}-a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n+1}-a_{n}\\). Of these new differences exactly \\(n_{t}\\) will be divisible by \\(b\\). Now, the number of differences \\(k-l\\) is augmented by the \\(n\\) differences \\((n+1)-1,(n+1)-2, \\cdots,(n+1)-n\\), and it is clear that \\(m \\geqq n_{t}\\) of the differences will be divisible by \\(b\\). Therefore, if we prove that at least as many of the \\(C_{n+1}^{2}\\) differences, \\(a_{k}-a_{l}\\), for \\(k>l\\) and \\(k, l=1,2, \\cdots, n+1\\), are divisible by \\(b\\) as before (that is, as among the differences \\(a_{k}-a_{l}\\) for \\(k, 1=1,2, \\cdots, \\boldsymbol{n}\\) ), then it will follow that of the number \\(C_{n_{1}}^{2}\\) of differences \\(a_{k}-a_{l}(k>l\\); \\(k, l=1,2, \\cdots, n)\\) no fewer will be divisible by \\(b\\) than were divisible among the differences \\(k-l\\), where \\(k, l=1,2, \\cdots, n\\). If \\(n+1\\) is divisible by \\(b\\), then our quest is ended: the result sought follows from what we have done (it is analagous to the case \\(n=m b\\) ). If \\(n+1\\) fails to be divisible by \\(b\\), then we adjoin another integer to the sequence \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n}, a_{n+1}\\), - and we may continue adjoining additional integers until their number does form a multiple of \\(b\\). This completes the proof of the initial assertion. The proposition of the problem follows immediately. If \\(b=p\\) is any prime number, then \\(p\\) divides at least as many factors \\(a_{k}-a_{l}\\) as it does factors \\(k-l\\); the same assertion will be true for \\(p^{2}, p^{3}, \\cdots\\). Thus, every prime \\(p\\) will enter the numerator as a factor to an order at least as great as it enters the denominator; therefore, the denominator of the fraction obtained by multiplying together all numbers of the form \\(\\frac{a_{k}-a_{l}}{k-l}\\) will divide the numerator, and so that product will be an integer.", "hints_and_answers": "Prove that for any integer \\(b\\) the number of differences \\(a_{k}-a_{l}\\) which are divisible by \\(b\\) is not less than the number of differences \\(k-l\\) which are divisible by \\(b\\).

{"problem": "(a) Ten primes, each less than 3000 , form an arithmetic progression. Find these prime numbers. (b) Prove that there do not exist eleven primes, all less than 20,000 , which can form an arithmetic progression.", "solution": "(a) Since all primes exceeding 2 are odd, the common difference of the arithmetic progression sought must be an even number; hence, we may eliminate 2 as a possible term of the progression. Also, since there are certainly three successive terms of the progression, all of which exceed 3 and which by themselves must form an arithmetic progression, the common difference \\(d\\) must be (according to problem 69 ) divisible by 6 , that is, divisible by both 2 and by 3. We now show that \\(d\\) must be divisible by 5 . Assume \\(d\\) is not divisible by 5 . Then the numbers \\[ a, a+d, a+2 d, a+3 d, a+4 d \\] all yield different remainders upon division by 5 (if two of the remainders are equal, then it is easily shown that \\(d\\) is divisible by 5 , a contradiction of the assumption just made). Thus, one of the numbers of the progression is then divisible by 5 . Since all the term of the progression are prime, this is a contradiction. Hence \\(d\\) must be divisible by 5 . We can show, in the same manner, that \\(d\\) must be divisible by 7 . (This conclusion cannot be reached for 11 , since there are to be only ten terms in the progression, and \\(a, a+d, \\cdots, a+9 d\\) would not necessarily provide a number divisible by 11.) Therefore, the common difference \\(d\\) of the progression must be a multiple of \\(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7=210\\); that is, \\(d=210 k\\). According to the conditions of the problem, \\[ a_{10}=a_{1}+9 d=a_{1}+1890 k<3000 . \\] This inequality is impossible for \\(k \\geqq 2\\), hence, necessarily, \\(k=1\\). It follows that \\[ a_{1}<3000-9 d=3000-1890=1110 . \\] Now, \\(210=11 \\cdot 19+1\\); consequently, the \\((m+1)\\) st term of the progression may be represented in the form \\[ a_{m+1}=a_{1}+(11 \\cdot 19+1) \\cdot m=11 \\cdot 19 m+\\left(a_{1}+m\\right) . \\] It follows that if \\(a_{1}\\) yields a remainder of 2 upon division by 11, then \\(a_{10}\\) is divisible by 11. If \\(a_{1}\\) yields a remainder of 3 when divided by 11 , then \\(a_{9}\\) is divisible by 11 , and so on. Therefore, \\(a_{1}\\) cannot yield upon division by 11 any of the remainders \\(2,3,4, \\cdots\\), or 10 . If \\(a_{1} \\neq 11\\), then since \\(a_{1}\\) is prime it cannot be divisible by 11 ; this means that either \\(a_{1}=11\\) or \\(a_{1}\\) yields a remainder of 1 upon division by 11 . Further, since \\(210=13 \\cdot 16+16+2\\), and so \\[ a_{m+1}=a_{1}+(13 \\cdot 16+2) m=13 \\cdot 16 m+\\left(a_{1}+2 m\\right) \\text {, } \\] it may be shown that if \\(a_{1}\\) is divisible by 13, it can yield as a remainder only one of the numbers \\(2,4,6,8,10\\), or 12 .

We must test each of the possibilities (for example, \\(a_{1}=11\\) is quickly found untenable, since then \\(a_{2}=221=13 \\cdot 17\\), which is not prime). Exactly one of the above primes, \\(a_{1}=199\\), will produce an acceptable progression: 199, 409, 619, 829, 1039, 1249, 1459, 1669, 1879, 2089 . (b) This problem is solved in a manner analogous to the solution of problem (a); however, the progression found there cannot be extended since the following term fails to be prime. If \\(a_{1} \\neq 11\\), then, proceeding exactly as in problem (a), we find that the common difference \\(d\\) of the progression sought must be a multiple of \\(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11=2310(d=2310 k)\\). It follows that \\[ a_{11}=a_{1}+23100 k>20,000 . \\] Hence we need investigate only the case for which \\(a_{1}=11\\). Here, we can have only \\(d=210 k\\). Since \\(210=13 \\cdot 16+2\\), we can write for the general term of the desired progression \\[ a_{n+1}=11+(13 \\cdot 16+2) k n=13(16 k n+1)+2(k n-1) . \\] However, for any \\(k=1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9\\), or 10 , we can always find an \\(n \\leqq 10\\) such that \\(k n-1\\) is divisible by 13 , whence \\(a_{n+1}\\) fails to be a prime number.

{"problem": "(a) Prove that, given five consecutive positive integers, it is always possible to find one which is relatively prime to all the rest. (b) Prove that among sixteen consecutive integers it is always possible to find one which is relatively prime to all the rest.", "solution": "(a) If the difference of two odd numbers does not exceed 4 , then they cannot have a common divisor which exceeds 4 . Thus, two of the five consecutive numbers can either have at most a common divisor of 2,3 , or 4 or be relatively prime. At least two of the five consecutive numbers must be odd, and of two consecutive odd numbers at least one will fail to be divisible by 3 . Hence there is at least one odd number among the five consecutive integers which fails to be divisible by 3 . This integer will necessarily be relatively prime to the remaining four integers. (b) The reasoning employed here closely resembles that used in problem (a), but it is much more involved. If the difference of two odd numbers does not exceed \\(k\\), then they cannot have a common divisor which exceeds \\(k\\). To determine whether two integers are relatively prime, it suffices to consider only prime factors; hence it suffices to show that, given sixteen consecutive integers, it is always possible to find one of them which fails to have in common with any one of the other integers a divisor of \\(2,3,5,7,11\\), or 13 . That integer will be relatively prime to all the others. First we discard the even numbers of the sixteen successive integers. There remain eight consecutive odd numbers. Divisibility by 3 clearly holds for either (1) the first, fourth, and seventh of these eight numbers, (2) for the second, fifth, and eighth numbers, or (3) for the third and sixth numbers. Divisibility by 5 holds for either the first and sixth, or for the second and seventh, or for the third and eighth, or for one number only (the fourth or the fifth). Divisibility by 7 holds either for the first and eighth or for only one of the other integers. One, and only one, of the odd numbers can be divisible by 11 , and only one by 13 . If not more than five of the eight consective odd numbers are divisible by one of the primes 3,5 , or 7 , then there must exist among the remaining three (or more) odd numbers at least one which is divisible neither by 11 nor by 13 . Since that number will fail to have \\(2,3,5,7,11\\), or 13 as a factor, it will be relatively prime to all the other integers of the original sequence of sixteen numbers. We now consider the case in which the number of odd integers divisible by 3,5 , or 7 does not exceed six (which is the maximal number of odd integers of the sequence which can be so divisible). We first assume that three of the eight odd numbers are divisible by 3 . Then, depending upon which three numbers these are (first and fourth and seventh, or second and fifth and eighth), two remaining numbers can be divisible by 5 (third and eighth, or first and sixth), and one of the remaining numbers might be divisible by 7 . If we strike out the (at most) five numbers divisible by 3 or by 5 , there will remain either the second and fifth and sixth or the third and fourth and seventh of the eight odd numbers. We consider the first case. The second, fifth and sixth odd numbers stand either in the fourth, tenth, and twelfth positions of the original sequence of sixteen numbers or in the third ninth and eleventh positions of that sequence. In the first-named positioning two of these odd numbers must fail to have 7 as a divisor; and, of these two, neither can have a common divisor of 13 with any other number of the original sequence, since both differ from all the other numbers by less than 13. Since at most one of these two numbers is divisible by 11 , at least one remains which cannot be divisible by \\(2,3,5,7,11\\), or 13 and so must be relatively prime to all the other numbers of the original sequence. In the second-named positioning (third, ninth, and eleventh), if one of these odd numbers has the factor 13 in common with another number of the original sequence of sixteen consecutive numbers, it can be only that number standing in the third position. If we throw out that number, we are left with numbers in the ninth and eleventh positions. Only one of these two numbers can be divisible by 7 ; whichever it is, the remaining one cannot have a factor of 11 in common with any other number of the original sequence, since it differs from all of them by a number less than 11. Hence at least one number will be relatively prime to all the others of the original sequence. The argument for the case in which the third, fourth, and seventh numbers of the sequence of odd integers remain after those divisible by 3 or by 5 are thrown out is quite analogous, and is left for the reader. If only two numbers of the sequence of eight odd numbers are divisible by 3 (the third and sixth), then it is possible for two of the remaining numbers (the first and eighth) to be divisible by 7 , and two more can be divisible by 5 (the second and seventh). If these six numbers are struck out, only the fourth and fifth of the eight odd numbers are retained, and these two are not divisible by 3,5 , or 7 . Each of these remaining two numbers will be relatively prime to the other fifteen numbers of the original sequence, since each of them will differ from the remaining fifteen numbers by less than 11, and hence could not share with any of them a common divisor of 11 or 13 . This completes the proof. Remark: The proposition may be proved for any sequence of successive integers fewer than sixteen (say, ten or twelve) by techniques similar to that used above. The proposition does not hold for a sequence of seventeen numbers. \\({ }^{\\dagger}\\) Whether such a proposition is true for \\(k>17\\) numbers, or for special numbers \\(k\\), is not known.", "hints_and_answers": "(a) This will be an odd number not divisible by 3 .

For example, if we begin with the numbers \\(32,1,110,7\\), we obtain the following pattern: \\begin{tabular}{rrrr} 32, & 1, & 110, & 7, \\\\ 31, & 109, & 103, & 25, \\\\ 78, & 6, & 78, & 6, \\\\ 72, & 72, & 72, & 72, \\\\ 0, & 0, & 0, & 0. \\end{tabular}", "solution": "We note, first, that the difference of two positive integers is odd if, and only if, one of the integers is odd and the other even; we obtain an even difference only from two even or two odd integers.

For four arbitrary integers \\(A, B, C\\), and \\(D\\), we have the following \"essentially different\" possible even-odd combinations and arrangements: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\text { (1) } e, e, e, e ; & \\text { (4) } e, o, e, o \\\\ \\text { (2) } e, e, e, o ; & \\text { (5) } e, o, o, o \\\\ \\text { (3) } e, c, o, o . & \\text { (6) } o, o, o, o \\end{array} \\] All other arrangements can be obtained by \"cyclic permutation\" of these six arrangements (that is, by moving an arrangement to the right, and putting the fourth integer in the first place, and so on, not changing the order of appearance). We shall show that, in every case, after not more than four steps (as described in the problem) we must arrive at four even numbers. First, combination (1) already consists of four even numbers; combination (6) achieves the desired effect in the first step; combination (4) becomes combination (6) in one step, so it arrives in the desired form in two steps; combination (3) becomes combination (4) in one step, so it becomes combination (1) in three steps; finally, combinations (2) and (5) become, in one step, combination (3) [for combination (5) we first employ cyclic permutation], so in four steps we achieve the sought combination (1). Thus, in every case, we arrive at a quadruple of four even numbers in at most four steps. We continue the process of forming new quadruples of numbers, and now we are working entirely with even integers. It is readily reasoned that after at most four more steps, we obtain numbers divisible by 4 (if some of the even numbers are not already divisible by 4 , we divide all numbers by 2 , and in four steps we have numbers divisible again by 2); in at most four more steps we obtain integers divisible by 8 , and so on. If the process is continued long enough, we must be able to arrive at a quadruple of numbers divisible by any desired power of 2 . Since the numbers we obtain are decreasing in absolute value, we must arrive at a point where we have at least one zero, and finally at a point where we have four zeros (this will occur in at most \\(4^{n}\\) steps, albeit we will usually arrive at this point much earlier). Remark: The analogous theorem may be proved for any number \\(2^{k}\\) of positive integers. For \\(n\\) numbers, where \\(n\\) is not a power of 2 , the proof does not carry through.

This produces an increasing sequence \\(a_{1}^{(1)}, a_{2}^{(1)}, \\cdots, a_{1}^{(1)}\\) (which may conceivably end at the first integer). If more than ten numbers appear in this sequence \\((i>10)\\), the problem is solved. If, however, \\(i<10\\), we cross out the integers already used, and from the remaining \\(101-i\\) integers we begin the construction of a new sequence, following the same procedure. We then obtain a new increasing sequence \\(a_{1}^{(2)}, a_{2}^{(2)}, \\cdots, a_{i_{2}}^{(2)}\\). Continuation of this process creates from the ordered set of 101 integers a number of increasing sequences. If any one of them contains more than ten integers, the problem has heen solved. Hence we need consider only the case in which none of the sequence we have made up contains more than ten integers. Since there are 101 integers in all, the number \\(k\\) of increasing sequences must in this case be at least equal to 11 . But then it is possible to select from the 101 integers a decreasing sequence of eleven integers. A procedure for doing this follows. We select as the final element of the sequence to be constructed the final element of the final sequence \\(a_{i_{k}}^{(k)}\\). Then if we select from the previous sequence that number among those of the original sequence not yet crossed out, which just precedes \\(a_{i_{k}}^{(k)}\\), that number will exceed \\(a_{i_{k}}^{(k)}\\); otherwise \\(a_{i_{k}}^{(k)}\\) would have appeared in the preceding sequence. This selected number \\(a_{j}^{(k-1)}\\) is placed to the left of \\(a_{i_{k}}^{(k)}\\) in the new sequence. Now we work with \\(a_{j}^{(k-1)}\\). In the sequence just preceding the \\((k-1)\\) st, the element which had appeared just before \\(a_{j}^{(k-1)}\\) (among those not already crossed out in the original sequence) will exceed \\(a_{j}^{(k-1)}\\). This number is placed to the left \\(a_{j}^{(k-1)}\\) in the new sequence being formed. We can continue in this manner, selecting larger and larger numbers, each appearing earlier in the initial array of 101 numbers, and it is clear that we can make at least eleven such selections. Remark: It can be proved in analogous way that \\((n-1)^{2}\\) positive integers can be arranged in such an order that no \\(n\\) of them will follow sequentially in either an increasing or a decreasing order, but that among \\(k>(n-1)^{2}\\) integers a sequence of \\(n\\) increasing, or decreasing, numbers can be selected sequentially from the initial array.", "hints_and_answers": "(b) Having made some arrangement of the numbers from 1 to 101 , choose the longest increasing sequence starting with the first term of this arrangement.

If again there are fewer than eleven numbers, then cross out also these numbers, and start over as before.

(c) Prove that if one of 100 numbers taken from the first 200 natural numbers is less than 16 , then one of those 100 numbers is divisible by another.", "solution": "(a) Reduce each of the 101 selected numbers by the greatest power of 2 which divides it, thus obtaining 101 odd numbers. Since there are precisely 100 distinct odd numbers from 1 to 200 , at least two of the 101 odd numbers must be identical. This means that among the 101 numbers originally selected there exist two whose factorizations differ only by a power of 2 . The smaller of these two numbers must divide the other. Remark: A proof by mathematical induction is also possible. (b) The desired numbers can be selected in the following manner: The fifty odd numbers from 101 to 199; the odd numbers from 51 to 99 , each multiplied by 2 (twenty-five numbers); the odd numbers from 27 to 49 , each multiplied by 4 (twelve numbers); the odd numbers from 13 to 25 , each multiplied by 8 (seven numbers); the odd numbers from 7 to 11 , each multiplied by 16 (three numbers); and finally, the three numbers \\(3 \\cdot 32,5 \\cdot 32\\), and \\(1 \\cdot 64\\). These total 100 numbers, all less than 200 , and none of which is divisible by any other. (c) Assume that it is possible to select 100 integers, none exceeding 200, such that no one of them is divisible by any other. We shall show that none of the numbers 1-15 inclusive can appear in the selected set. As in the solution of problem (a), we divided out of each number the largest power of 2 which appears as a factor. We obtain a second set consisting of 100 odd numbers, none exceeding 200 . No two of these odd numbers belonging to the second set can be equal (otherwise the corresponding original numbers would differ from each other only by a factor which is a power of 2 , and so one would be divisible by the other). Accordingly, the 100 odd numbers of the second set are \\(1,3,5, \\cdots, 199\\). Since 15 divides 45 , the integer \\(2^{\\alpha} \\cdot 15\\) of the initial set must have \\(\\alpha>0\\), since otherwise 15 would divide \\(45 \\cdot 2^{\\beta}\\), which also appears in the initial set. This means that 15 cannot have appeared in the initial set. The same line of reasoning eliminates the possibility that 13,11 , or 9 appeared in the initial set. We now consider the integer 7 . It is clear that \\(7 \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}\\), which is a number of the initial set, must have \\(\\alpha \\geqq 1\\). But suppose that \\(\\alpha=1\\). Since 7 divides 49 , which in turn divides 147 , and since both \\(49 \\cdot 2^{\\beta}\\) and \\(147 \\cdot 2^{\\gamma}\\) belong to the initial set, it is clear that \\(\\beta=\\gamma\\) is impossible, hence not both \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) can be zero. But \\(\\gamma\\) is certainly zero, since the initial set centains no integer exceeding 200 . Therefore, \\(7 \\cdot 2\\) must divide \\(49 \\cdot 2^{\\beta}\\); this eliminates both 7 and 14 from appearance in the initial set. The same line of reasoning shows that the integers \\(5,10,3,6\\), and 12 cannot belong to the initial set. The integer 1 is automatically rejected, by hypothesis, and the integer 2 is rejected, since its inclusion would give precisely the set of 100 odd numbers between 1 and 200 , a set which clearly fails to meet the conditions of the problem. There remain for consideration only the integers 4 and 8 . Were 4 to belong to the initial set, then \\(2^{\\alpha}\\) could not be a factor of any other member of the initial set unless \\(\\alpha \\leqq 1\\). But this is impossible, since it would eliminate the appearance of the integer 3 from the second set (neither 3 nor 6 , as has been shown, can belong to the initial set). By similar reasoning the integer 8 is shown to be impossible of inclusion in the initial set. Therefore, none of the integers from 1 to 15 , inclusive, can appear in the initially selected set. Remark: It can proved, in general, that out of the first \\(2 n\\) (or fewer) integers it is impossible to select \\((n+1)\\) integers having the property that no one of them is divisible by another, but that it is possible to select \\(n\\) (or fewer) such integers.

If a number \\(a\\) is in the interval \\[ \\frac{1000}{m} \\geqq a>\\frac{1000}{m+1} \\] then there are obviously, \\(m\\) integral multiples of \\(a\\) which do not exceed 1000: \\(a, 2 a, 3 a, \\cdots, m a\\).

Second Solution. We introduce an important variation of the foregoing type of reasoning. The number of terms of the sequence \\(1,2, \\cdots, 1000\\) which are divisible by an integer \\(a_{k}\\) is obviously the greatest integer \\(\\left[\\frac{1000}{a_{k}}\\right]\\) in \\(\\frac{1000}{a_{k}}\\). Since the least common multiple of any two of the integers \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n}\\) exceeds 1000 , not one of the numbers \\(1,2,3, \\cdots, 1000\\) can be divisible by two of the integers \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n}\\). It follows that the number of terms of the sequence \\(1,2,3, \\cdots, 1000\\) which are divisible by at least one of the integers \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n}\\) is equal to the sum \\[ \\left[\\frac{1000}{a_{1}}\\right]+\\left[\\frac{1000}{a_{2}}\\right]+\\left[\\frac{1000}{a_{3}}\\right]+\\cdots+\\left[\\frac{1000}{a_{n}}\\right] . \\] Since there are 1000 numbers in the sequence \\(1,2, \\cdots, 1000\\), it is clear that \\[ \\left[\\frac{1000}{a_{1}}\\right]+\\left[\\frac{1000}{a_{2}}\\right]+\\cdots+\\left[\\frac{1000}{a_{n}}\\right] \\leqq 1000 . \\] But the greatest integer in a fraction differs from the fraction itself by less than 1 ; that is, \\[ \\left[\\frac{1000}{a_{1}}\\right]>\\frac{1000}{a_{1}}-1,\\left[\\frac{1000}{a_{2}}\\right]>\\frac{1000}{a_{2}}-1, \\cdots,\\left[\\frac{1000}{a_{n}}\\right]>\\frac{1000}{a_{n}}-1 . \\] Consequently, \\[ \\left(\\frac{1000}{a_{1}}-1\\right)+\\left(\\frac{1000}{a_{2}}-1\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(\\frac{1000}{a_{n}}-1\\right)<1000 ; \\] that is, \\[ \\frac{1000}{a_{1}}+\\frac{1000}{a_{2}}+\\frac{1000}{a_{3}}+\\cdots+\\frac{1000}{a_{n}}<1000+n<2000, \\] and so \\[ \\frac{1}{a_{1}}+\\frac{1}{a_{2}}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{a_{n}}<2 . \\] Remarks: The estimation of this bound can be made very precise. Consider all the multiples of those given integers which do not exceed 500 . Now, \\(k_{1}\\) of the given integers will exceed \\(500 ; k_{2}+k_{3}\\) of the integers will not exceed 500 , but will exceed \\(\\frac{500}{2} ; k_{4}+k_{5}\\) of them will not exceed \\(\\frac{500}{2}\\), but will exceed \\(\\frac{500}{3}\\); and so on. It follows, as in the first solution, that the total number of integers not exceeding 500, and which are multiples of at least one of the given \\(n\\) numbers, is equal to \\[ \\left(k_{2}+k_{3}\\right)+2\\left(k_{4}+k_{5}\\right)+3\\left(k_{6}+k_{7}\\right)+\\cdots . \\] Therefore, \\[ \\left(k_{2}+k_{3}\\right)+2\\left(k_{4}+k_{5}\\right)+3\\left(k_{6}+k_{7}\\right)+\\cdots<500 . \\] We note now that the difference \\[ 500-\\left[\\left(k_{2}+k_{3}\\right)+2\\left(k_{4}+k_{5}\\right)+\\cdots\\right] \\] expresses the number of integers, not exceeding 500, which are not multiples of any one of the given integers; and the difference \\[ 1000-\\left(k_{1}+2 k_{2}+3 k_{3}+\\cdots\\right) \\] is the number of integers not exceeding 1000 which fail to be multiples of any one of the given integers. Consequently, \\(500-\\left[\\left(k_{2}+k_{3}\\right)+2\\left(k_{4}+k_{5}\\right)+3\\left(k_{6}+k_{7}\\right)+\\cdots\\right]<1000-\\left(k_{1}+2 k_{2}+3 k_{3}+\\cdots\\right)\\), from which we obtain \\[ \\left(k_{1}+k_{2}\\right)+2\\left(k_{3}+k_{4}\\right)+3\\left(k_{\\mathrm{s}}+k_{6}\\right)+\\cdots<500 . \\] It remains to note that \\[ \\begin{aligned} 2 k_{1}+3 k_{2}+4 k_{3}+5 k_{4}+6 & k_{5}+7 k_{6}+\\cdots \\\\ < & \\left(k_{1}+2 k_{2}+3 k_{3}+4 k_{4}+5 k_{5}+6 k_{6}+\\cdot\\right) \\\\ & +\\left[\\left(k_{1}+k_{2}\\right)+2\\left(k_{3}+k_{4}\\right)+3\\left(k_{5}+k_{6}\\right)+\\cdots\\right] \\\\ & <1000+500=1500 \\end{aligned} \\] Thus, the sum of the reciprocals of all of the numbers is less than \\[ \\frac{2 k_{1}+3 k_{2}+4 k_{3}+\\cdot \\cdot}{1000} \\] or less than \\(1 \\frac{1}{2}\\). Analogously, if initially we consider the multiples of those given integers not exceeding 333, we can prove that the sum of the reciprocals of the given numbers is less than \\(1 \\frac{1}{5}\\).

Since \\([x+y]\\) is the largest integer which fails to exceed \\(x+y\\), it follows that \\([x+y] \\geqq[x]+[y]\\). (2) First Solution. Write \\(x=[x]+\\alpha\\), where \\(0 \\leqq \\alpha<1\\). Assume that the integer \\([x]\\), when divided by \\(n\\), yields the quotient \\(q\\) and the remainder \\(r\\) : \\[ [x]=q n+r \\quad(0 \\leqq r \\leqq n-1) . \\] We then have \\[ \\begin{gathered} \\frac{[x]}{n}=q+\\frac{r}{n} ; \\\\ {\\left[\\frac{[x]}{n}\\right]=q ;} \\\\ x=q n+r+\\alpha=q n+r_{1} ; \\end{gathered} \\] where \\(r_{1}=r+\\alpha<n ; \\frac{x}{n}=q+\\frac{r_{1}}{n} ;\\left[\\frac{x}{n}\\right]=q=\\left[\\frac{[x]}{n}\\right]\\); which proves the assertion. Second Solution. Consider all integers divisible by \\(n\\) but not exceeding \\(x\\). Clearly, there are \\(\\left[\\frac{x}{n}\\right]\\) of them. Consider, also, all integers divisible by \\(n\\) but not exceeding \\([x]\\). There are \\(\\left[\\frac{[x]}{n}\\right]\\) of these. Since these two integers are the same, we have \\[ \\left[\\frac{[x]}{n}\\right]=\\left[\\frac{x}{n}\\right] \\text {. } \\] (3) First Solution. Let \\(x=[x]+\\alpha\\). Since \\(0 \\leqq \\alpha<1\\), then \\(\\alpha\\) is equal to one of, or lies between two successive fractions of, the sequence \\[ \\frac{0}{n}, \\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{2}{n}, \\cdots, \\frac{n-1}{n}, \\frac{n}{n} . \\] Assume that the fractions in question are \\(\\frac{k}{n}\\) and \\(\\frac{k+1}{n}\\); that is, that \\[ \\frac{k}{n} \\leqq \\alpha<\\frac{k+1}{n} \\text {. } \\] Now, we have \\[ \\begin{aligned} x+\\frac{n-k-1}{n} & =[x]+\\alpha+\\frac{n-k-1}{n}<[x]+\\frac{k+1}{n}+\\frac{n-k-1}{n} \\\\ & =[x]+1, \\\\ x+\\frac{n-k}{n} & =[x]+\\alpha+\\frac{n-k}{n} \\geqq[x]+\\frac{k}{n}+\\frac{n-k}{n}=[x]+1, \\end{aligned} \\] and \\[ \\begin{aligned} x+\\frac{n-1}{n} & =[x]+\\alpha+\\frac{n-1}{n}<[x]+\\frac{k+1}{n}+\\frac{n-1}{n} \\\\ & =[x]+\\frac{n+k}{n} \\leqq x+2 . \\end{aligned} \\] It follows that \\[ \\begin{gathered} {[x] \\leqq\\left[x+\\frac{1}{n}\\right] \\leqq \\cdots \\leqq\\left[x+\\frac{n-k-1}{n}\\right]<[x]+1} \\\\ {[x]+1 \\leqq\\left[x+\\frac{n-k}{n}\\right] \\leqq \\cdots \\leqq\\left[x+\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right]<[x]+2} \\end{gathered} \\] that is, \\[ \\begin{gathered} {[x]=\\left[x+\\frac{1}{n}\\right]=\\cdots=\\left[x+\\frac{n-k-1}{n}\\right],} \\\\ {\\left[x+\\frac{n-k}{n}\\right]=\\cdots=\\left[x+\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right]=[x]+1 .} \\end{gathered} \\] Since after the first \\(n-k\\) numbers, there remain \\(k\\), we have \\[ [x]+\\cdots+\\left[x+\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right]=(n-k)[x]+k([x]+1)=n[x]+k . \\] But this is can be shown to be equal to the integral part of \\(n x\\). Since \\(k \\leqq n \\alpha<k+1\\), then \\(n \\alpha=k+\\beta\\), where \\(0 \\leqq \\beta<1\\). As a result, \\[ [n x]=[n[x]+n a]=[n[x]+k+\\beta]=n[x]+k . \\] This proves that \\[ [x]+\\left[x+\\frac{1}{n}\\right]+\\cdots+\\left[x+\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right]=[n x] \\text {. } \\] Second Solution. Consider the left member of the given equation. If \\(0 \\leqq x<\\frac{1}{n}\\), then all the numbers \\(x, x+\\frac{1}{n}, \\cdots, x+\\frac{n-1}{n}\\) are less than 1 , and so the integral part of each is 0 ; also \\([n x]=0\\). Thus the equation holds for such values of \\(x\\). Now let \\(x\\) be arbitrary. If we multiply \\(x\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\), all the terms on the left are \"shifted\" once to the right, and the final term, \\[ \\left[x+\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right] \\] becomes \\([x+1]\\), which exceeds \\([x]\\) by 1 . This means that multiplicat!on of \\(x\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) increases the left member of the equation by 1 . The right member is also increased by 1 when multiplied by \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\). For \\(x\\) it is possible to find a number \\(\\alpha\\), where \\[ 0 \\leqq \\alpha<\\frac{1}{n} \\] such that \\(x\\) differs from \\(\\alpha\\) by \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\), where \\(m\\) is an integer.

Now, if an integer \\(x\\) is a divisor of the integer \\(k\\), then the point \\((x, y)\\) is a point on the graph of the hyperbola \\(x y=k\\). Conversely, if the hyperbola \\(x y=k\\) contains an integer point, then the \\(x\\)-coordinate is a divisor of \\(k\\).

The number \\(t_{k}\\) of divisors of \\(k\\) is thus equal to the number of abscissas of integer points lying on the hyperbola \\(x y=k\\).

(b) The desired numbers \\(N\\) cannot have more than three digits, since in the extreme case \\(\\left(9^{2}+9^{2}+9^{2}+9^{2}=4 \\cdot 9^{2}=324\\right)\\) we obtain only a three-digit number. Hence we can write, for the integers, \\(N=100 x+10 y+z\\), where \\(x, y\\), and \\(z\\) are the respective digits of the number (from left to right, and allowing the possibility of \\(x=0\\), or even both \\(x=0\\) and \\(y=0\\) ). The problem then imposes the condition \\[ 100 x+10 y+z=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} \\text {, } \\] or, equivalently, \\[ (100-x) x+(10-y) y=z(z-1) . \\] The last equation implies that, necessarily, \\(x=0\\); if this is not the case, we have on the left an integer not less than \\(90[x \\geqq 1,100-x \\geqq\\) \\(90,(10-y) y \\geq 0]\\), and the integer on the right is not more than \\(9 \\cdot 8=72\\). Consequently, equation (1) can be replaced by \\[ (10-y) y=z(z-1) . \\] It is readily verified that this equation cannot be satisfied by any nonzero \\(y\\) (recall that \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) are digits). If \\(y=0\\), then there remains only the trivial possibilities \\(z=0\\) or \\(z=1\\). Hence, exc \\(\\epsilon\\) pt for \\(N=0\\), there is only the solution \\(N=1\\).", "hints_and_answers": "(a) 145. (b) Only the number 1 ."}
{"problem": "Find all integers equal to: (a) the square of the sum of the digits of the number; (b) the sum of the digits of the cube of the number.", "solution": "(a) Clearly, the numbers \\(N\\) which are sought cannot have more than four digits, since the sum of the digits of a five-digit number cannot exceed \\(5.9=45\\), and the square of this number is 2025 , a four-digit number. Further, since \\(4.9=36\\), and \\(36^{2}=1296\\), if \\(N\\) is a four-digit number satisfying the condition of the problem, its first digit cannot exceed 1 . But \\(1+3 \\cdot 9=28\\), and \\(28^{2}=784\\), whence even four-digit numbers are excluded from consideration. Thus \\(N\\) can have at most three digits. Assume, now, that \\(N=\\) \\(100 x+10 y+z\\), where \\(x, y\\), and \\(z\\) are digits (the possibility \\(x=0\\) is allowed, as is \\(x=y=0\\) ). Now the condition of the problem can be written in the form \\[ 100 x+10 y+z=(x+y+z)^{2}, \\] or \\[ \\begin{aligned} 99 x+9 y & =(x+y+z)^{2}-(x+y+z) \\\\ & =(x+y+z)(x+y+z-1) . \\end{aligned} \\] It follows from the above equality that one of \\((x+y+z)\\) or \\((x+y+z-1)\\) is divisible by 9 (not both can be divisible by 3 since they are relatively prime). Also, \\(1 \\leqq x+y+z \\leqq 27\\). We shall investigate all possible cases. (1) \\(x+y+z-1=0 ; 99 x+9 y=0, x=y=0, z=1 ; N=1\\). (2) \\(x+y+z=9 ; 99 x+9 y=9 \\cdot 8=72, x=0,9 y=72, y=8, z=1\\); \\(N=81\\left[=(8+1)^{2}\\right]\\). (3) \\(x+y+z-1=9 ; 99 x+9 y=9 \\cdot 10=90, x=0,9 y=90\\), which is impossible. (4) \\(x+y+z=18 ; 99 x+9 y=18 \\cdot 17=306, x=3, y=1, z=18-\\) \\((3+1)=14\\), which is impossible.

(6) \\(x+y+z=27 ; 99 x+9 y=27 \\cdot 26=702, x=7, y=1, z=27-\\) \\((7+1)=19\\), which is impossible. Therefore, the conditions of the problem are satisfied only by the numbers 1 and 81 . (b) The cube of a three-digit integer can contain no more than nine digits; hence, the sum of the digits of the cube of a threedigit number cannot exceed \\(9 \\cdot 9=81<100\\). This implies that the numbers sought cannot be three-digit numbers; and the same kind of reasoning will show that such a number cannot have more than three digits. The integer, or integers, sought can have at most two digits. The cube of a two-digit integer cannot have more than six digits, and the sum of the digits of such a cube cannot exceed \\(6.9=54\\), whence the numbers sought cannot exceed 54 . However, if a number not exceeding 54 is cubed, the first digit of the cube cannot be greater than 1; but then the sum of the digits of the cube cannot be greater than \\(1+5 \\cdot 9=46\\). Thus, the numbers sought cannot exceed 46. Proceeding as before, we find that if an integer does not exceed 46, its cube contains at most five digits, and since this cube is less than 99,999 , the sum of the digits is at most equal to \\(4 \\cdot 9+8=44\\). The cube of 44 is a five-digit number ending with the digit 4 . Hence the number 44 must be throwil out as a possibility. The numbers sought cannot exceed 43. Now we make use of the fact that the sum of the digits of every positive integer yields the same remainder upon division by 9 as does the number itself upon division by 9 . It follows that any of the integers sought must yield the same remainder upon division by 9 as does its cube. This is possible only if this remainder is \\(-1,0\\), or 1 (solution of \\(r^{3}=r\\) ). Thus, the numbers sought do not exceed 43 , and they can yield upon division by 9 only the remainders \\(-1,0\\), or 1 .

Therefore, if \\(x \\geqq 5\\), the sum \\(1 !+2 !+\\cdots+x\\) ! terminates with the digit 3 and therefore cannot be the square of any integer \\(y\\).

For \\(z=1\\) any value of \\(x\\), and the corresponding obvious value of \\(y\\), will suffice. Let \\(z \\geqq 3\\). We note that \\[ 1 !+2 !+3 !+\\cdots+8 !=46,233 . \\] This number is divisible by 9 , but not by 27 , whereas for all \\(n \\geqq 9\\) the number 9 ! is divisible by 27 . The sum \\(9 !+10 !+\\cdots+x !\\) is therefore divisible by 27 ; and so, for \\(x \\geqq 8\\), the sum \\(1 !+2\\) ! \\(+\\cdots+\\) \\(x\\) ! is divisible by 9 , but not by 27 . In order for \\(y^{z}\\) to be divisible by 9 it is necessary that \\(y\\) be divisible by 3, but then \\(y^{z}\\) must be divisible by 27 (for \\(z \\geqq 3\\) ). Consequently, for \\(x \\geqq 8\\) and \\(z \\geqq 3\\) the given equation has no solution in integers. It remains to consider the case for \\(x<8\\). We have \\(1 !=1=1^{z}\\), where \\(z\\) can be any integer \\(1 !+2 !=3\\) (which does not provide an integer solution for \\(z \\geqq 3\\) ), \\(1 !+2 !+3 !=3^{2}\\) (a solution arrived at earlier, but not for the case of odd \\(z\\) ) and \\[ \\begin{aligned} 1 !+2 !+3 !+4 ! & =33 \\\\ 1 !+2 !+\\cdots+5 ! & =153 \\\\ 1 !+2 !+\\cdots+6 ! & =873 \\\\ 1 !+2 !+\\cdots+7 ! & =5913 \\end{aligned} \\] As can be easily verified, none of these integers is an integral power \\((\\geqq 3)\\) of any natural number.

The equation \\[ x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=2 x y z \\] is satisfied by \\(x=y=z=0\\). It is obvious that no other solution is available which involves zero value for any one of \\(x, y\\), or \\(z\\); hence we may assume that none of them can vanish. We can write \\[ \\begin{aligned} & x=2^{\\alpha} x_{1}, \\\\ & y=2^{\\beta} y_{1}, \\\\ & z=2^{\\gamma} z_{1}, \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}\\) are odd (if any one of \\(x, y, z\\) is initially odd, then the exponent for 2 can be taken to be 0 ). Since \\(x, y\\), and \\(z\\) enter the equation symmetrically, we may assume, with generality, that \\(\\alpha \\leqq \\beta \\leqq \\gamma\\). We shall now determine by what power of 2 the left member of the equation is divisible. (1) If \\(\\alpha<\\beta \\leqq \\gamma\\), or else if \\(\\alpha=\\beta=\\gamma\\), then after factoring out \\((2 \\alpha)^{2}=2^{2 \\alpha}\\), there will remain the sum of an odd and two even numbers, or else the sum of three odd numbers-that is, an odd number.

On the other hand, the right member of the equation is divisible by \\(2^{\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma+1}\\). Also, the right member must be divisible by the same power of 2 as is the left member. For case (1) we must have \\(2 \\alpha=\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma+1\\). Since \\(\\alpha \\leqq \\beta \\leqq \\gamma\\), we arrive at the untenable inequality \\(2 \\alpha \\geqq 3 \\alpha+1\\). For case (2) it follows that \\(2 \\alpha+1=\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma+1\\). Since \\(\\alpha=\\) \\(\\beta<\\gamma\\), the following inequality is implied, which again is impossible: \\(2 \\alpha+1>3 \\alpha+1\\). Therefore, there fails to exist any solution in integers for \\(x^{2}+\\) \\(y^{2}+z^{2}=2 x y z\\), except the trivial one \\(x=y=z=0\\). Second Solution. Since the sum of the squares is to be an even number, it may be reasoned that either all three of the numbers \\(x^{2}\\), \\(y^{2}, z^{2}\\) (hence also \\(x, y\\), and \\(z\\) ) are even, or one of them is even and two are odd. But in the last event, the sum would be divisible only by 2 and the product \\(2 x y z\\) would be divisible by 4 . Hence we must conclude that \\(x, y\\), and \\(z\\) must all be even: \\(x=2 x_{1}, y=2 y_{1}, z=2 z_{1}\\). If we substitute these into the given equation and divide through by 4 , we obtain \\[ x_{1}^{2}+y_{1}^{2}+z_{1}^{2}=4 x_{1} y_{1} z_{1} \\] As above, this equation implies that \\(x_{1}, y_{1}\\), and \\(z_{1}\\) are all even numbers, and so we can write \\(x_{1}=2 x_{2}, y_{1}=2 y_{2}, z_{1}=2 z_{2}\\), which yields the equation \\[ x_{2}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}+z_{2}^{2}=9 x_{2} y_{2} z_{2}, \\] which, in turn, implies that also \\(x_{2}, y_{2}\\), and \\(z_{2}\\) are all even numbers. Continuation of this process leads to the conclusion that the following set of numbers are all even: \\[ \\begin{aligned} & x, y, z ; \\\\ & x_{1}=\\frac{x}{2}, \\quad y_{1}=\\frac{y}{2}, \\quad z_{1}=\\frac{z}{2} ; \\\\ & x_{2}=\\frac{x}{4}, \\quad y_{2}=\\frac{y}{4}, \\quad z_{2}=\\frac{z}{4} ; \\\\ & x_{3}=\\frac{x}{8}, \\quad y_{3}=\\frac{y}{8}, \\quad z_{3}=\\frac{z}{8}, \\quad \\cdots ; \\\\ & x_{k}=\\frac{x}{2^{k}}, \\quad y_{k}=\\frac{y}{2^{k}}, \\quad z_{k}=\\frac{z}{2^{k}} ; \\quad \\cdots \\end{aligned} \\] (the numbers \\(x_{k}, y_{k}, z_{k}\\) satisfy the equation \\(x_{k}^{2}+y_{k}^{2}+z_{k}^{2}=2^{k+1} x_{k} y_{k} z_{k}\\) ). But this is possible only if \\(x=y=z=0\\). (b) As above, it may be proved that the only integer solution of the equation \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+v^{2}=2 x y z v\\) is \\(x=y=z=v=0\\). Here, it suffices to make the special investigation for the case where the highest power of 2 which divides \\(x, y, z\\), and \\(v\\) is the same; that is, when \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} x=2^{\\alpha}(2 k+1), & y=2^{\\alpha}(2 l+1), \\\\ z=2^{\\alpha}(2 m+1), & v=2^{\\alpha}(2 n+1), \\end{array} \\] where \\(\\alpha\\) is a nonnegative integer, and \\(k, l, m\\), and \\(n\\) are integers. Then \\[ \\begin{aligned} x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+v^{2}= & 2^{2 \\alpha}\\left[\\left(4 k^{2}+4 k+1\\right)+\\left(4 l^{2}+4 l+1\\right)\\right. \\\\ & \\left.+\\left(4 m^{2}+4 m+1\\right)+\\left(4 n^{2}+4 n+1\\right)\\right] \\\\ = & 2^{2 \\alpha+2}\\left(k^{2}+k+l^{2}+l+m^{2}+m+n^{2}+n+1\\right) \\\\ = & 2^{2 \\alpha \\div 2}[k(k+1)+l(l+1)+m(m+1)+n(n+1)+1] . \\end{aligned} \\] Now, the last expression in brackets must be odd (the terms which are products of two successive numbers are even). Therefore, the greatest power of 2 which divides the left member of the equation has exponent \\(2 \\alpha+2\\). But, in the original equation, the highest power of 2 which divides the right member is \\(2^{4 a+1}\\). Accordingly, we must conclude that \\(2 \\alpha+2=4 \\alpha+1\\), which is untenable for any integer \\(\\alpha\\).

To show this, assume, for example, that \\(z>\\) \\(\\frac{k x y}{2}\\). Then consider not \\(x, y, z\\), but the lesser integers \\(x, y\\), and \\(z_{1}=\\) \\(k x y-z\\), which clearly also satisfy equation (1): \\[ x^{2}+y^{2}+(k x y-z)^{2}=k x y(k x y-z) . \\] If any integer of this new triple is greater than the product of the other two multiplied by \\(\\frac{k}{2}\\), we again make a similar substitution until the conditions of (2) are satisfied (after which the process will fail to yield decreasing numbers for \\(x, y, z)\\).

Hence, we have \\(2 \\leqq k x \\leqq 3\\); that is, \\(k x\\) is equal to 2 or 3 . But if \\(k x=2\\), then equation (1) assumes the form \\[ x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=2 y z, \\] or \\[ x^{2}+(y-z)^{2}=0 \\text {; } \\] thus \\(x=0\\) and \\(k x=0\\) instead of 2. Therefore, \\(k x=3\\), which means that \\(k\\) can have only value 1 or 3 . It is readily verified by examples that these values for \\(k\\) are possible [see the solution of problem (b)]. (b) Reasoning similar to that employed for problem (a) is used here. There we had \\(x^{2}+2 y^{2} \\geqq k x y^{2}\\); since \\(k x=3\\), this inequality can be rewritten in the form \\[ x^{2}+2 y^{2} \\geqq 3 y^{2}, \\] or \\[ x^{2} \\geqq y^{2} \\] However, we assumed \\(x \\leqq y\\); consequently, \\(x=y\\). Assume now that in the basic equation, (1), \\(x=y, k x=3\\). We obtain \\[ 2 x^{2}+z^{2}=3 x z \\text {, } \\] or \\[ (z-x)(z-2 x)=0 . \\] Thus, \\(z=x\\) or \\(z=2 x\\). Since \\[ z \\leqq \\frac{k x y}{2}=\\frac{3 y}{2}=\\frac{3 x}{2} \\] it is impossible for \\(z\\) to be equal to \\(2 x\\). Therefore, \\(z=x\\). Accordingly, for condition (2) to be fulfilled, we must have \\(x=\\) \\(y=z\\). But, inasmuch as \\(k x=3, x\\) can be only 1 or 3 , and we obtain two solutions for equation (1): \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} x=y=z=1 & (k=3) \\\\ x=y=z=3 & (k=1) \\end{array} \\] In the solution of problem (a) we saw that any three integers \\(x\\), \\(y, z\\) which satisfy condition (1) can produce other solutions, by successive replacements of the form \\(z_{1}=k x y-z\\) of (2). But if \\(z_{1}=\\) \\(k x y-z\\), then \\(z=k x y-z_{1}\\); hence every solution of equation (1) can be obtained from the least solution by successive substitutions of form \\(z_{1}=k x y-z\\). In particular, we obtain in this way the following solutions for equation (1) (up to 1000): (1) For \\(k=3\\) : \\begin{tabular}{rrr} \\(\\frac{x}{1}\\) & \\(\\frac{y}{1}\\) & \\(\\frac{z}{1}\\) \\\\ 1 & 1 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 5 \\\\ 1 & 5 & 13 \\\\ 1 & 13 & 34 \\\\ 1 & 34 & 89 \\\\ 1 & 89 & 233 \\\\ 1 & 233 & 610 \\\\ 2 & 5 & 29 \\\\ 2 & 29 & 169 \\\\ 2 & 169 & 985 \\\\ 5 & 13 & 194 \\\\ 5 & 29 & 433 \\end{tabular} (2) For \\(k=1\\) : \\begin{tabular}{rrr} \\(\\frac{x}{3}\\) & \\(\\frac{y}{3}\\) & \\(\\frac{z}{3}\\) \\\\ 3 & 3 & 6 \\\\ 3 & 6 & 15 \\\\ 3 & 15 & 39 \\\\ 3 & 39 & 102 \\\\ 3 & 102 & 267 \\\\ 3 & 267 & 699 \\\\ 6 & 15 & 87 \\\\ 6 & 87 & 507 \\\\ 15 & 39 & 582 \\end{tabular} The fact that solutions corresponding to \\(k=1\\) can be obtained from those corresponding to \\(k=3\\) by simple multiplication by 3 follows from the fact that the least triple \\((3,3,3)\\) satisfying the equation for \\(k=1\\) is related to the least triple for \\(k=3\\) by the factor 3 .", "hints_and_answers": "(a) It is possible to show that if \\(x, y\\), and \\(z\\) satisfy the given equality, and if \\(z>\\frac{k x y}{2}\\), then these numbers can be reduced in such a way as to continue to satisfy the equality.

{"problem": "Find (within the first thousand) all possible pairs of relatively prime numbers such that the square of one of the integers when increased by 125 is divisible by the other.", "solution": "If the relatively prime pair \\(x, y\\) is to meet the conditions of the problem, the following equations must be solvable in integers: \\[ \\begin{aligned} & x^{2}+125=u y, \\\\ & y^{2}+125=v x . \\end{aligned} \\] We shall show that a solution of these equations produces not merely the relatively prime pair \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) satisfying the conditions, but two other pairings \\(x, u\\) and \\(y, v\\) which satisfy the same conditions. That is, we shall show that \\(x^{2}+125\\) is divisible by \\(u\\) and \\(u^{2}+125\\) is divisible by \\(x\\), and also that \\(y^{2}+125\\) is divisible by \\(v\\) and \\(v^{2}+125\\) is divisible by \\(y\\). First, \\(x^{2}+125=u y\\) means that \\(x^{2}+125\\) is divisible by \\(u\\). The equalities yield \\[ \\begin{aligned} u^{2} y^{2} & =x^{4}+250 x^{2}+125^{2} ; \\\\ u^{2}(v x-125) & =x^{4}+250 x^{2}+125^{2}, \\end{aligned} \\] and, finally, \\[ x\\left(u^{2} v-x^{3}-250 x\\right)=125\\left(u^{2}+125\\right), \\] from which it follows that \\(u^{2}+125\\) is divisible by \\(x\\) (which is relatively prime to 125 , otherwise \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) would not be relatively prime). Also, the integers \\(x\\) and \\(u\\) are relatively prime, for if \\(x\\) and \\(u\\) had a common divisor of \\(d\\), then \\(125=u y-x^{2}\\) would also be divisible by \\(d\\) (that is, \\(d=5\\) ), and, consequently, \\(y\\) would be divisible by \\(d\\) (since \\(y^{2}=v x-125\\) ). It may be shown, in exactly the same way, that the integers \\(y\\) and \\(v\\) are relatively prime, and the square of either when increased by 125 is divisible by the other. We redesignate our integers \\(x, y, u, v\\) as follows: \\(x=x_{0}, y=x_{1}\\), \\(u=x_{-1}, v=x_{2}\\). If \\(u^{2}+125=x_{-2} x_{\\text {, }}\\) then the pair of integers \\(u, x_{-2}\\), that is, \\(x_{-1}, x_{-2}\\), also satisfy the conditions of the problem. Thus, if \\(v^{2}+125=x_{3} y\\), then the pair of integers \\(v, x_{3}\\), that is, \\(x_{2}, x_{3}\\), also satisfy this condition. Hence, beginning with an integer pair satisfying the conditions of the problem, it is possible to construct an infinite double-end array of integers, \\[ \\cdots, x_{-2}, x_{-1}, x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\cdots, \\] where neighboring pairs satisfy the equation \\[ \\begin{aligned} & \\frac{x_{\\alpha}^{2}+125}{x_{\\alpha+1}}=x_{\\alpha-1} ; \\\\ & \\frac{x_{\\alpha+1}^{2}+125}{x_{\\alpha}}=x_{\\alpha+2} . \\end{aligned} \\] Further, in the given array the ratio of the sum of a pair neighboring an integer to that integer is constant: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{x_{\\alpha-1}+x_{\\alpha+1}}{x_{\\alpha}} & =\\frac{x_{\\alpha-1} x_{\\alpha+1}+x_{\\alpha+1}^{2}}{x_{\\alpha} x_{\\alpha+1}}=\\frac{\\left(x_{\\alpha}^{2}+125\\right)+x_{\\alpha+1}^{2}}{x_{\\alpha} x_{\\alpha+1}} \\\\ & =\\frac{x_{\\alpha}^{2}+\\left(x_{\\alpha+1}^{2}+125\\right)}{x_{\\alpha} x_{\\alpha+1}}=\\frac{x_{\\alpha}+x_{\\alpha} x_{\\alpha+2}}{x_{\\alpha} x_{\\alpha+1}}=\\frac{x_{\\alpha}+x_{\\alpha+2}}{x_{\\alpha+1}} . \\end{aligned} \\] This observation is helpful in extending the double-end array of integers above: it we designate \\(\\frac{x_{\\alpha-1}+x_{\\alpha+1}}{x_{\\alpha}}\\) by \\(t\\), we will have \\[ \\begin{aligned} & x_{\\alpha+1}=t x_{\\alpha}-x_{\\alpha-1}, \\\\ & x_{\\alpha-1}=t x_{\\alpha}-x_{\\alpha+1} . \\end{aligned} \\] Now we must develop a procedure which will help us determine all such arrays which yield solutions of the problem. We note, first, that if \\(x_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}+1} \\geqq x_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\), then \\[ x_{\\alpha+2}=\\frac{x_{\\alpha+1}^{2}+125}{x_{\\alpha}}>\\frac{x_{\\alpha+1}^{2}}{x_{\\alpha}} \\geqq x_{\\alpha+1} \\] and if \\(x_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}-1} \\geqq x_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\), then \\(x_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}-2}>x_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}-1}\\); hence every chain of integers augments in both directions from some least integer (or equal pair of least integers, and two neighboring numbers of the chain can be equal only if both are 1). Let \\(x_{0}\\) be the least integer of the solution-chain: \\[ x_{1} \\geqq x_{0}, \\quad x_{-1} \\geqq x_{0} \\] We shall show that \\(x_{0}<\\sqrt{125}<12\\). We first observe that the number \\(t\\), referred to above; is an integer exceeding 2. In fact, it follows from the equation \\[ t=\\frac{x_{\\alpha-1}+x_{\\alpha+1}}{x_{\\alpha}}=\\frac{x_{\\alpha}+x_{\\alpha+2}}{x_{\\alpha+1}} \\] that \\(t\\) is an integer. Hence \\(x_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}\\) and \\(x_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}+1}\\) are relatively prime, and consequently \\[ t=\\frac{x_{\\alpha-1}+x_{\\alpha+1}}{x_{\\alpha}} \\] cannot have in its denominator a divisor of \\(x_{\\alpha+1}\\), and \\[ t=\\frac{x_{a}+x_{\\alpha+2}}{x_{\\alpha+1}} \\] cannot have in its denominator any divisor of \\(x_{\\alpha}\\). Further, \\[ t=\\frac{x_{\\alpha}^{2}+x_{\\alpha+1}^{2}+125}{x_{\\alpha} x_{\\alpha+1}}>\\frac{x_{\\alpha}^{2}+\\alpha_{\\alpha+1}^{2}}{x_{\\alpha} x_{\\alpha+1}} \\geqq 2 \\] or \\(\\quad x_{\\alpha}^{2}+x_{\\alpha+1}^{2} \\geqq 2 x_{\\alpha} x_{\\alpha+1} \\quad\\left(\\right.\\) since \\(\\left.\\quad x_{\\alpha}^{2}+x_{\\alpha+1}^{2}-2 x_{\\alpha} x_{\\alpha+1}=\\left(x_{\\alpha}-x_{\\alpha+1}\\right)^{2} \\geqq 0\\right)\\). Thus, \\(t \\geqq 3\\). Now, since \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left(x_{1}-x_{0}\\right)\\left(x_{-1}-x_{0}\\right) & =x_{1} x_{-1}+x_{0}^{2}-x_{0} x_{1}-x_{0} x_{-1} \\\\ & =x_{1} x_{-1}-x_{0}^{2}-x_{0}\\left(x_{1}-x_{0}\\right)-x_{0}\\left(x_{-1}-x_{0}\\right) \\\\ & \\leqq x_{1} x_{-1}-x_{0}^{2}=125 \\end{aligned} \\] it follows that at least one of the (nonnegative) integers \\(x_{1}-x_{0}\\) and \\(x_{-1}-x_{0}\\) fails to exceed 11. Suppose that \\(x_{1}-x_{0} \\leqq 11\\). We have \\[ \\begin{gathered} t=\\frac{x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+125}{x_{0} x_{1}} \\\\ t-2=\\frac{x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+125-2 x_{0} x_{1}}{x_{0} x_{1}}=\\frac{\\left(x_{1}-x_{0}\\right)^{2}+125}{x_{0}\\left[x_{0}+\\left(x_{1}-x_{0}\\right)\\right]} . \\end{gathered} \\] But \\(t \\geqq 3\\) and so \\(t-2 \\geqq 1\\); consequently, \\[ \\left(x_{1}-x_{0}\\right)^{2}+125 \\geqq x_{0}^{2}+x_{0}\\left(x_{1}-x_{0}\\right) \\] which is impossible if \\(x_{0} \\geqq 12>\\left(x_{1}-x_{0}\\right)\\) [since here \\(x_{0}^{2}>125\\), \\(\\left.x_{0}\\left(x_{1}-x_{0}\\right)>\\left(x_{1}-x_{0}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\). It remains now to test for \\(x_{0}\\) all integers that are less than 12 and which are relatively prime to 125 ; for such an \\(x_{0}, x_{1}\\) is an integer such that \\(x_{0}+125\\) is divisible by \\(x_{1}\\) (that is, \\(x_{1}\\) is a divisor of \\(\\left.x_{0}^{2}+125\\right)\\), and \\(x_{1}^{2}+125\\) is divisible by \\(x_{0}\\). Since \\(x_{0}^{2}+125=x_{1} x_{-1}\\), we may use the fact that \\(x_{1}\\) is the smaller of the neighbors of \\(x_{0}\\) to obtain \\[ x_{0} \\leqq x_{1} \\leqq \\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}+125} \\] It is not difficult to verify that all pairs \\(x_{0}, x_{1}\\) satisfying the conditions of the problem can be expressed as follows: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} 1,1\\left(t=\\frac{1^{2}+1^{2}+125}{1 \\cdot 1}=127\\right) ; & 1,2\\left(t=\\frac{1^{2}+2^{2}+125}{1 \\cdot 2}=65\\right) ; \\\\ 1,3\\left(t=\\frac{1^{2}+3^{2}+125}{1 \\cdot 3}=45\\right) ; & 1,6\\left(t=\\frac{1^{2}+6^{2}+125}{1 \\cdot 6}=27\\right) ; \\\\ 1,7\\left(t=\\frac{1^{2}+7^{2}+125}{1 \\cdot 7}=25\\right) ; & 1,9\\left(t=\\frac{1^{2}+9^{2}+125}{1 \\cdot 9}=23\\right) ; \\\\ 2,3\\left(t=\\frac{2^{2}+3^{2}+125}{2 \\cdot 3}=23\\right) ; & 6,7\\left(t=\\frac{6^{2}+7^{2}+125}{6 \\cdot 7}=5\\right) . \\end{array} \\] This yields the following solution arrays: \\[ \\begin{aligned} & \\cdots, 15,001,126,1,1,126,15,001, \\cdots \\\\ & \\cdots, 4094,63,2,129,8383, \\cdots \\\\ & \\cdots, 1889,42,1,3,134,6027, \\cdots \\\\ & \\cdots, 15,261,566,21,1,6,161,4341, \\cdots \\\\ & \\cdots, 10,826,449,18,1,7,174,4343, \\cdots \\\\ & \\cdots, 7369,321,14,1,9,206,4729, \\cdots \\\\ & \\cdots, 22,658,987,43,2,3,67,1538, \\cdots \\\\ & \\cdots, 2501,522,109,23,6,7,29,138,661,3167, \\cdots \\end{aligned} \\] All possible pairs of relatively prime positive integers \\(x, y\\), less than 1000 , such that \\(x^{2}+125\\) is divisible by \\(y\\) and \\(y^{2}+125\\) is divisible by \\(x\\), are given by the following tables. \\begin{tabular}{rrrrrr} \\(\\frac{x}{126}\\) & \\(\\frac{y}{1}\\) & \\(\\frac{x}{449}\\) & \\(\\frac{y}{18}\\) & \\(\\frac{x}{522}\\) & \\(\\frac{y}{109}\\) \\\\ 1 & 1 & 18 & 1 & 109 & 23 \\\\ 63 & 1 & 1 & 7 & 23 & 6 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 7 & 174 & 6 & 7 \\\\ 2 & 129 & 321 & 14 & 7 & 29 \\\\ 42 & 1 & 14 & 1 & 29 & 138 \\\\ 1 & 3 & 1 & 9 & 138 & 661 \\\\ 3 & 134 & 9 & 206 & & \\\\ 566 & 21 & 987 & 43 & & \\\\ 21 & 1 & 43 & 2 & & \\\\ 1 & 6 & 2 & 3 & & \\\\ 6 & 161 & 3 & 67 & & \\end{tabular}", "hints_and_answers": "Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be a pair of numbers satisfying the conditions of the problem.

Let us assume that \\(2 v-3<0\\); This is possible only if \\(v=0\\) or \\(v=1\\). In the first event, the first equation of system (1) yields \\(y+z+u=0\\), which is untenable for \\(y, z, u\\) all positive. Hence it must be assumed that all the integers \\(v, t, t, s\\) are positive, and that \\(v=1\\). In this event equation (2) can be rewritten in the form \\[ x=(2 w-3) y+(2 t-3) z+(2 s-3) u+v^{2}+t^{2}+s^{2}+1 . \\] We now consider the several possibilities. The numbers \\(x, y, z, u\\) are all distinct. Here, the integers \\(v, w, t, s\\) are also all different; if, for example, \\(v=w\\), the difference of the first two of the equations (1) yields \\(y-x=2 v(x-y)\\), which is impossible for positive \\(v\\) and \\(x \\neq y\\). Further, if we assume \\(v=1\\), the first of equations ( 1 ) yields \\(2 x=y+z+u-1\\), \\[ x=\\frac{1}{2} y+\\frac{1}{2} z+\\frac{1}{2} u-\\frac{1}{2} \\text {, } \\] which is inconsistent with equation (3), where the coefficients of \\(y\\), \\(z, u\\) in the right member are positive integers (since \\(w, t\\), or \\(s\\) cannot be equal to 1 because they are distinct from \\(v\\) which is equal to 1 ). Therefore, this case is not possible. Precisely two of the integers \\(x, y, z, u\\) are equal. Here we must separately investigate two cases. If \\(z=u\\), then \\(t=s\\). Equation (3) and the first of equations (1) now yield: \\[ \\begin{aligned} x & =(2 w-3) y+2(2 t-3) z+w^{2}+2 t^{2}+1 \\\\ 2 x & =y+2 z-1 \\end{aligned} \\] As before, these equations are inconsistent.

Assume \\(2 t-5<0\\); since \\(t>0\\) and \\(t \\neq 1\\) (for \\(v=1, t \\neq v\\), since \\(z \\neq x\\) ), it follows that \\(t=2\\). Now, if twice the first of equations ( 1 ) is added to the third equation, we obtain \\[ 4 z+4 x+6=4 x+2 z+3 u, \\] that is, \\(z=\\frac{3}{2} u-3\\). Substituting this into equation (4), along with \\(t=2\\), we have \\[ (4 s-13) u+2 s^{2}+22=0 . \\] Clearly, \\(4 s-13<0\\). Since \\(s>0, s \\neq 1, s \\neq 2\\), we must have \\(s=3\\). If these values are now substituted into equations (1), there results a system of three linear equations in three unknowns: \\[ \\begin{aligned} x+z+u & =2 s+1, \\\\ 2 x+u & =4 z+4, \\\\ 2 x+z & =6 u+9 . \\end{aligned} \\] We easily find that \\(x(=y)=96, z=57, u=40\\). The integers \\(x, y, z, u\\) are two pairs of equal numbers. Assume that \\(x=y\\) and \\(z=u\\). In this event, the first of equations (1) yields \\(x=\\) \\(2 z-1\\); if this is substituted in (2), we obtain \\[ x=(2 t-3) z+t^{2}+1, \\] and so \\[ (2 t-5) z+t^{2}+2=0 . \\] It follows that \\(2 t-5<0\\), and since \\(t>0, t \\neq 1\\), we have \\(t=2\\). Equations (1) may now be written \\[ \\begin{aligned} & x+2 z=2 x+1, \\\\ & 2 x+5=4 z+4 \\end{aligned} \\] whence \\(x(=y)=11, z(=u)=6\\). Three of the integers \\(x, y, z, u\\) are equal.

Since now \\(x, y, z\\) are assumed to be relatively prime, it follows that at most one of these unknowns can be even; if two them, for example, are even, then the third must be even, and hence they would not be relatively prime.

(The existence of such a limiting number follows from problem 148.) Actually, \\(\\left(n / a_{2}\\right)^{n}<n\\) ! for every \\(n\\) exceeding 6 [if \\(\\alpha_{2}>e\\), and if \\(n>6\\), in view of problem \\(\\left.150, n !>(n / e)^{n}\\right]\\). Further, from the results of problems 145 and 149 , it follows that, for \\(n \\geqq 3\\), the following inequalities hold: \\[ \\begin{aligned} & n>e>\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^{n}=\\frac{(n+1)^{n}}{n^{n}}, \\\\ & n^{n+1}>(n+1)^{n}, \\\\ & n=n>n+1 \\end{aligned} \\] consequently, for \\(n \\geq 3, \\sqrt[n]{n}\\) diminishes as \\(n\\) increases. It is readily seen that if \\(n\\) becomes very large, \\(\\sqrt[n]{n}\\) approaches as close to unity as we wish. It follows, for example, that \\(\\log 10^{k} / \\frac{1}{10^{k}}-k / 10^{k}\\), for sufficiently large \\(k\\), can be made as small as we wish. Let us now select an \\(N\\) such that the inequality \\(N^{\\prime} \\bar{N}<e / a_{1}\\) holds. Then for \\(n>N\\) the approximation \\(\\sqrt[n]{n}<e / a_{1}\\) is still more improved, and from problem 150 it follows that \\[ n !<\\left(\\frac{n / e}{n_{V} / \\bar{n}}\\right)^{n}<\\left(\\frac{n}{a_{1}}\\right)^{n} \\] The inequality of problem 150 admits a great deal of precision. It is possible to show that for sufficiently large \\(n\\) the number \\(n\\) ! is approximated by \\(C \\sqrt{n}(n / e)^{n}\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant equal to \\(\\sqrt{2 \\pi}\\) : \\[ n ! \\approx \\sqrt{2 \\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^{n \\dagger} \\] [more precisely, it is possible to prove that if \\(n\\) increases without bound, ratio \\[ \\frac{n !}{\\overline{2 \\pi n}(n / e)^{n}} \\] tends to unity. (See the book by A. M. Yaglom and E. M. Yaglom, Nonelementary Problems Treated by Elementary Means, Library of the Mathematical Society, Volume 5)].", "solution": "A proof by mathematical induction is given. We show first that, for any natural number \\(n\\), \\[ n !>\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^{n} \\] This inequality clearly holds for \\(n=1: 1 !=1>\\frac{1}{e}\\). Assume that inequality (1) holds for some positive integer \\(n\\); we must show that \\[ (n+1) !>\\left(\\frac{n+1}{e}\\right)^{n+1} \\] In view of problem 149 (a), we have \\[ \\begin{aligned} & e>\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^{n} \\\\ & \\frac{e}{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^{n}}>1 \\end{aligned} \\] From (1) we obtain \\[ \\begin{aligned} (n+1) ! & =(n+1) n !>\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^{n}(n+1)=\\left(\\frac{n+1}{e}\\right)^{n+1} \\frac{n^{n} e}{(n+1)^{n}} \\\\ & =\\left(\\frac{n+1}{e}\\right)^{n+1} \\frac{e}{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^{n}}>\\left(\\frac{n+1}{e}\\right)^{n+1} . \\end{aligned} \\] It follows, by the principle of mathematical induction, that (1) is valid for all natural numbers \\(n\\). We now deal with the inequality \\[ n !<n\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^{n} \\] We show that this inequality holds for all integers \\(n>6\\). With the aid of logarithm tables (natural logarithms are used here) it is readily verified that inequality (2) is valid for \\(n=7\\) : \\[ 7 !<7\\left(\\frac{7}{e}\\right)^{7} \\] that is, \\(6 !<\\left(\\frac{7}{e}\\right)^{7}\\) for \\(\\ln 6 !=\\ln 720 \\approx 6.58\\), and \\(\\ln \\left(\\frac{7}{e}\\right)^{7}=7(\\ln 7-1)\\) \\(\\approx 6.62\\).

Since inequality (2) holds for \\(n=7\\), it follows by mathematical induction that it will hold for all \\(n\\) exceeding 6 .

This shows that the roots of equation (1) do not depend upon \\(n\\) [since the roots of (2) are independent of \\(n\\) ]. The reasoning used here cannot be considered a legitimate solution to the problem, inasmuch as the existence of the limit shown in (2) has not been es. tablished and hence cannot be legitimately employed for (3).

Without an assignment of value for \\(n\\) we apparently cannot determine these roots. However, let us assume that \\[ 1+\\frac{1}{x}=x . \\] The successive simplifications of the fraction yield \\[ \\begin{aligned} & 1+\\frac{1}{x}=x \\\\ & 1+\\frac{1}{x}=x \\end{aligned} \\] and we finally arrive at the identity \\(x=x\\).

Since the equation has at most two roots, and we have found two roots for it, these represent the complete solution of the problem.

If we assumed the contrary, that is, if \\[ \\left(a_{i_{\\alpha}}-a_{i_{\\beta}}\\right)\\left(a_{i_{\\alpha-1}}-a_{i_{\\beta+1}}\\right)<0 \\] then the permutation which reverses the order \\(a_{i_{\\alpha}}, a_{i_{\\alpha+1}}, a_{i_{\\alpha+2}}, \\cdots, a_{i_{\\beta}}\\) would decrease the value of the sum \\(\\Phi\\), since the difference of the new sum \\(\\Phi^{\\prime}\\) and the initial sum \\(\\Phi\\) would then be \\[ \\begin{aligned} D^{\\prime}-\\mathscr{D} & =-2 a_{i_{\\alpha-1}} a_{i_{\\beta}}-2 a_{i_{\\alpha}} a_{i_{\\beta+1}}+2 a_{i_{\\alpha-1}} a_{i_{\\alpha}}+2 a_{i_{\\beta}} a_{i_{\\beta+}} \\\\ & =2\\left(a_{i_{\\alpha}}-a_{i_{\\beta}}\\right)\\left(a_{i_{\\alpha-1}}-a_{i_{\\beta+1}}\\right) . \\end{aligned} \\] This observation enables us to find the full solution of the problem. First, since a cyclic permutation of all the given numbers (the permutation which preserves the relative positions of the numbers-for example, writing them in a circle and merely rotating the circle) does not change the value of \\(\\phi\\), we can assume that \\(a_{i_{1}}\\) is the smallest of the numbers, that is, \\(i_{1}=1\\). It is then possible to assume that \\(a_{i_{2}}\\) and \\(a_{i_{n}}\\) follow in order of magnitude. In fact, if for example, \\(a_{i_{\\beta}}<a_{i_{2}}(\\beta \\neq n)\\), then we would have \\(\\left(a_{i_{2}}-a_{i_{\\beta}}\\right)\\left(a_{i_{1}}-a_{i_{\\beta+1}}\\right)<0\\), and if \\(a_{i_{\\beta}}<a_{i_{n}}(\\beta \\neq 2)\\), then we would have \\(\\left(a_{i_{1}}-a_{i_{\\beta-1}}\\right)\\left(a_{i_{n}}-a_{i_{\\beta}}\\right)<0\\). Since it is possible to change the order of the \"links\" of the chain \\(a_{i_{1}}, a_{i_{2}}, a_{i_{3}}, \\cdots, a_{i_{n}}, a_{i_{1}}\\) to the reversed order without changing the value of \\(\\emptyset\\), we can assume that \\(a_{i_{2}}<a_{i_{n}}, i_{2}=2\\), and \\(i_{n}=3\\). Further, we assert that the numbers \\(a_{i_{3}}, a_{i_{n-1}}\\) follow in this order in magnitude, within the pattern of the numbers \\(a_{i_{1}}, a_{i_{2}}, a_{i_{n}}\\) already considered. In fact, if, for example, \\(a_{i_{3}}>a_{i_{\\beta}}(\\beta \\neq 1,2 ; n-1, n)\\), then we would have \\(\\left(a_{i_{3}}-a_{i_{\\beta}}\\right)\\left(a_{i_{2}}-a_{i_{\\beta+1}}\\right)<0\\). But since we have, moreover, \\(\\left(a_{i_{3}}-a_{i_{n-1}}\\right)\\left(a_{i_{2}}-a_{i_{n}}\\right)>0\\), it follows that \\(a_{i_{3}}<a_{i_{n-1}}\\), that is, \\(a_{i_{3}}=a_{4}\\) and \\(a_{i_{n-1}}=a_{5}\\). It is similarly shown that \\(a_{i_{4}}\\) and \\(a_{i_{n-3}}\\) follow in magnitude after \\(a_{i_{4}}<a_{i_{n-2}}\\left(i_{4}=6, i_{n-2}=7\\right)\\), that the numbers \\(a_{i_{5}}\\) and \\(a_{i_{n-3}}\\) follow in magnitude after the previously determined \\(a_{i_{5}}<a_{i_{n-3}}\\left(i_{5}=8, i_{n-3}=9\\right)\\), and so on. Finally, we can set down the following scheme. If \\(n=2 k\\) (even), then \\[ \\begin{aligned} & \\left\\langle a_{2}-a_{4}-a_{6}-\\cdots-a_{n-2} \\backslash a_{n}\\right. \\\\ & a_{1} \\backslash a_{3}-a_{5}-a_{7}-\\cdots-a_{n-1} / \\end{aligned} \\] if \\(n=2 k+1\\) (odd), then \\[ \\begin{aligned} & a_{2}-a_{4}-a_{6}-\\cdots-a_{n-1} \\\\ & a_{1} a_{3}-a_{5}-a_{7}-\\cdots-a_{n} . \\end{aligned} \\] (The schema represents the order of the numbers; for example, for even \\(n\\) we have the order \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{4}, a_{6}, \\cdots, a_{n-2}, a_{n}, a_{n-1}, \\cdots, a_{7}, a_{5}, a_{3}\\) ). Second Solution. If the order obtained in the first solution could, in some manner, have been guessed at, the verification could be made by mathematical induction. In fact, for \\(n=4\\) the proof is quite simple [see the solution of problem (a)]. Assume now that for some even \\(n\\) the sum \\(\\Phi_{n}\\) in the arrangement given by part (a) for the numbers \\(a_{1}<a_{2}<\\cdots<a_{n}\\) is less than the sum \\(\\theta_{n}^{\\prime}\\) corresponding to any other order. We shall prove that the sum \\(\\emptyset_{n+1}\\) corresponding to the scheme shown in part \\((a)\\), as it concerns the \\(n+1\\) numbers \\(a_{1}<a_{2}<\\cdots<a_{n}<a_{n+1}\\), is less than the sum \\(\\emptyset_{n+1}^{\\prime}\\) corresponding to any other ordering of the \\(n+1\\) numbers. We have \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Phi_{n+1}-\\Phi_{n} & =\\left(a_{n}-a_{n+1}\\right)^{2}+\\left(a_{n+1}-a_{n-1}\\right)^{2}-\\left(a_{n}-a_{n-1}\\right)^{2} \\\\ & =2 a_{n+1}^{2}-2 a_{n} a_{n+1}-2 a_{n-1} a_{n+1}+2 a_{n-1} a_{n} \\\\ & =2\\left(a_{n+1}-a_{n}\\right)\\left(a_{n+1}-a_{n-1}\\right) . \\end{aligned} \\] On the other hand, if in the order answering to a sum \\(\\Phi_{n+1}^{\\prime}\\) the number \\(a_{n+1}\\) were to stand between two numbers \\(a_{\\alpha}\\) and \\(a_{\\beta}\\), and if \\(\\Phi_{n}^{\\prime}\\) answers the array of \\(n\\) numbers obtained from the array of \\(n+1\\) numbers leading to a sum \\(\\Phi_{n+1}^{\\prime}\\) by striking out the number \\(a_{n+1}\\), then \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\Phi_{n+1}^{\\prime}-\\Phi_{n}^{\\prime} & =\\left(a_{\\alpha}-a_{n+1}\\right)^{2}+\\left(a_{n+1}-a_{\\beta}\\right)^{2}-\\left(a_{\\alpha}-a_{\\beta}\\right)^{2} \\\\ & =2 a_{n+1}^{2}-2 a_{\\alpha} a_{n+1}-2 a_{\\beta} a_{n+1}+2 a_{\\alpha} a_{\\beta} \\\\ & =2\\left(a_{n+1}-a_{\\alpha}\\right)\\left(a_{n+1}-a_{\\beta}\\right) \\geqq \\Phi_{n+1}-\\Phi_{n} \\end{aligned} \\] Thus, \\[ \\Phi_{n+1}-\\Phi_{n+1}^{\\prime}=\\left[\\Phi_{n}-\\Phi_{n}^{\\prime}\\right]+\\left[\\left(\\Phi_{n+1}-\\Phi_{n}\\right)-\\left(\\Phi_{n+1}^{\\prime}-\\Phi_{n}^{\\prime}\\right)\\right] \\leqq 0 \\] (the first pair of brackets parentheses encloses a nonpositive number by the induction hypotheses; the second pair does so by the proof). Here, if the \\(\\operatorname{sum} \\Phi_{n-1}^{\\prime}\\) differs from \\(\\Phi_{n+1}\\), then either \\(\\Phi_{n}-\\Phi_{n}^{\\prime}<0\\) (and, consequently, \\(\\left.\\Phi_{n+1}-\\Phi_{n+1}^{\\prime}<0\\right)\\), or \\(\\left(\\Phi_{n+1}-\\Phi_{n}\\right)-\\left(\\Phi_{n+1}^{\\prime}-\\Phi_{n}^{\\prime}\\right)<0\\) (and, consequently, \\(\\mathscr{D}_{n+1}<\\mathscr{D}_{n+1}^{\\prime}\\) ). The transition from \\(n\\) to \\(n+1\\) is carried out in a similar manner for odd \\(n\\). Third Solution. This problem has a less involved geometrical solution. We represent the numbers \\(a_{1}<a_{2}<a_{3}<\\cdots<a_{n}\\) by points \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, \\cdots, A_{n}\\) on a number axis; we designate the intervals \\(\\overline{A_{1} A_{2}}, \\overline{A_{2} A_{3}}, \\cdots, \\overline{A_{n-1} A_{n}}\\), respectively, by \\(d_{1}, d_{2}, \\cdots, d_{n-1}\\). Then the sum \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathscr{D} & =\\left(a_{i_{1}}-a_{i_{2}}\\right)^{2}+\\left(a_{i_{2}}-a_{i_{3}}\\right)^{2}+\\cdots+\\left(a_{i_{n-1}}-a_{i_{n}}\\right)^{2}+\\left(a_{i_{n}}-a_{i_{1}}\\right)^{2} \\\\ & =\\overline{A_{i_{1}} A_{i_{2}}^{2}}+\\overline{A_{i_{2}} A_{i_{3}}^{2}}+\\cdots+\\overline{A_{i_{n}} A_{i_{1}}^{2}} \\end{aligned} \\] is equal to the sum of the squares of interval lengths, or \"links\" \\(A_{i_{1}} A_{i_{2}} A_{i_{3}} \\cdots A_{i_{n-1}} A_{i_{n}} A_{i_{1}}\\) [all of which lie on the one straight line; see Figure \\(14(\\mathrm{a})]\\). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_26_a05473b927f418828747g-284.jpg?height=133&width=526&top_left_y=1797&top_left_x=224) \\(a\\) ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_01_26_a05473b927f418828747g-284.jpg?height=110&width=547&top_left_y=1818&top_left_x=836) \\(b\\) Figure 14 Since the closed overlying curve covers the whole segment \\(\\overline{A_{1} A_{n}}\\), each of the segments \\(\\overline{A_{k} A_{k+1}}=d_{k}\\) enters at least twice into its com- position (once in the direction from \\(A_{k}\\) to \\(A_{k+1}\\) and again in the reverse direction).

Further, let \\(\\overline{A_{k-1} A_{k}}=d_{k-1}\\) and \\(\\overline{A_{k} A_{k+1}}=d_{k}\\) be two adjacent segments. It is clear that if the link of the overlying curve which covers the segment \\(\\overline{A_{k} A_{k+1}}\\) going from \\(A_{k}\\) to \\(A_{k+1}\\) commences at the point \\(A_{k}\\), then the link covering this segment in the reverse direction cannot terminate at the point \\(A_{k}\\).

By the Pythagorean theorem, \\[ \\overline{B_{i} B_{i+1}}=\\sqrt{B_{i} A_{i+1}^{2}+B_{i+1} A_{i+1}^{2}} . \\] Now, \\(\\overline{B_{i} A_{i+1}}=a_{i}\\), and \\(\\overline{B_{i+1} A_{i+1}}=\\left|1-a_{i+1}\\right|\\); consequently, \\[ \\overline{B_{i} B_{i+1}}=\\sqrt{a_{i}^{2}+\\left(1-a_{i+1}\\right)^{2}} . \\] Hence the sum in which we are interested, \\[ \\begin{aligned} & \\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}+\\left(1-a_{2}\\right)^{2}}+\\sqrt{a_{2}^{2}+\\left(1-a_{3}\\right)^{2}} \\\\ & \\quad+\\cdots+\\sqrt{a_{n-1}^{2}+\\left(1-a_{n}\\right)^{2}}+\\sqrt{a_{n}^{2}+\\left(1-a_{1}\\right)^{2}} \\end{aligned} \\] is equal to the length of the broken line \\(B_{1} B_{2} \\cdots B_{n+1}\\). It is obvious that the length of the broken line \\(B_{1} B_{2} \\cdots B_{n+1}\\) is not less than the length of the segment \\(\\overline{B_{1} B_{n+1}}\\). We shall now find the length of this segment. We construct the right triangle \\(B_{1} C B_{n+1}\\) (Figure 16). Then \\[ \\overline{B_{1} C}=\\overline{A_{2} A_{3}}+\\overline{A_{4} A_{5}}+\\cdots+\\overline{A_{n} A_{n+1}}=\\frac{n}{2}, \\] and \\[ \\overline{C B_{n+1}}=\\overline{A_{1} A_{2}}+\\overline{A_{3} A_{4}}+\\cdots+\\overline{A_{n-1} A_{n}}=\\frac{n}{2} \\] (for \\(\\overline{A_{1} B_{1}}=\\overline{A_{n+1} B_{n+1}}=\\left|1-a_{1}\\right|\\) ). It follows that \\[ \\overline{B_{1} B_{n+1}}=\\sqrt{\\left(B_{1} C\\right)^{2}+\\left(C B_{n+1}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)^{2}}=\\frac{n \\sqrt{2}}{2} . \\] This proves the inequality sought. It is not difficult now to determine when the equality holds. In order to arrive at the equality, all the points \\(B_{2}, B_{3}, \\cdots, B_{n}\\) must lie on the line segment \\(\\overline{B_{1} B_{n+1}}\\) (that is, \\(B_{i}\\) must coincide with the points of intersection of the line segments \\(\\overline{B_{1} B_{n+1}}\\) and \\(\\overline{A_{i} A_{i+1}}\\). Because the segment \\(\\overline{B_{1} B_{n+1}}\\) forms a \\(45^{\\circ}\\) angle with \\(\\overline{B_{1} C}\\left(\\overline{B_{1} C}=\\overline{C B_{n+1}}\\right)\\), it follows that \\[ \\overline{B_{1} A_{2}}=\\overline{A_{2} B_{2}}=\\overline{B_{3} A_{4}}=\\overline{A_{4} B_{4}}=\\cdots=\\overline{B_{n-1} A_{n}}=\\overline{A_{n} B_{n}}, \\] that is, \\(a_{1}=\\left(1-a_{2}\\right)=a_{3}=\\left(1-a_{4}\\right)=\\cdots=a_{n-1}=\\left(1-a_{n}\\right)\\). Thus for \\(n\\) even, the equality holds for \\[ \\begin{aligned} & a_{1}=a_{3}=\\cdots=a_{n-1}=a, \\\\ & a_{2}=a_{4}=\\cdots=a_{n}=1-a, \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(a\\) is any arbitrary number.

Clearly, the length of \\(\\overline{M N}\\) is \\(\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}\\right)^{2}}\\). Now, the sum \\(\\overline{M_{1} N_{1}}+\\overline{M_{2} N_{2}}\\) is equal to twice the length of the segment \\(M N^{\\prime}\\), where \\(N^{\\prime}\\) is the point of the trapezoid \\(M_{1} N_{1} N_{2} M_{2}\\) just above \\(M\\), and \\(\\overline{M N^{\\prime}}\\) is obviously shorter than \\(\\overline{M N}\\). The inequality of the problem follows immediately. The equality holds only if the points \\(M_{1}\\) and \\(M_{2}\\) coincide, that is, if \\(x_{1}=x_{2}\\). Remark: Many interesting inequalities are suggested by this last proof. For example, consider the unit sphere with center at the origin (Figure 18). Let \\(M_{1}\\) and \\(M_{2}\\) be any two points in the \\(X Y\\)-plane within (or on) the sphere, and let \\(N_{1}\\) and \\(N_{2}\\) be the points of intersection, with the sphere, of perpendiculars to the plane rising from \\(M_{1}\\) and \\(M_{2}\\), respectively. Let \\(M\\) be the midpoint of segment \\(\\overline{M_{1} M_{2}}\\), and construct the perpendicular \\(\\overline{M N}\\) in the plane containing \\(M_{1}, M_{2}, N_{1}\\), and \\(N_{2}\\), where \\(N\\) is the intersection with the sphere. Obviously, \\(M N\\) will intersect the segment from \\(N_{1}\\) to \\(N_{2}\\), and this intersection point we label \\(N^{\\prime}\\). If \\(\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)\\) are the coordinates of points \\(M_{1}\\) and \\(M_{2}\\), then \u2020 This is obvious for positive \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\); it is easily verified that this will hold even if one of the numbers is (or both are) negative. Also, it suffices to consider only positive \\(x_{1}\\) and \\(x_{2}\\), since in any other event the inequality is emphasized. \\[ \\begin{aligned} M_{1} N_{1} & =\\sqrt{1-x_{1}^{2}-y_{1}^{2}} ; \\\\ M_{2} N_{2} & =\\sqrt{1-x_{2}^{2}-y_{2}^{2}} ; \\\\ M N & =\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}\\right)^{2}} ; \\\\ M N^{\\prime} & =\\frac{1}{2}\\left(M_{1} N_{1}+M_{2} N_{2}\\right) . \\end{aligned} \\] And since \\(M N^{\\prime} \\leqq M N\\), it follows that \\[ \\sqrt{1-x_{1}^{2}-y_{1}^{2}}+\\sqrt{1-x_{2}^{2}-y_{2}^{2}} \\leqq 2 \\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}}{2}\\right)^{2}}, \\] provided, however, that all the expressions under the radical are nonnegative.

We obtain the inequality \\[ \\begin{aligned} & \\sqrt{1-x_{1}^{2}-y_{1}^{2}}+\\sqrt{1-x_{2}^{2}-y_{2}^{2}}+\\sqrt{1-x_{3}^{2}-y_{2}^{2}} \\\\ & \\leqq 3 \\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}}{3}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}}{3}\\right)^{2}} . \\end{aligned} \\] This results from the fact that segment \\(M N^{\\prime}\\) of the perpendicular from \\(M\\) does not exceed segment \\(M N\\).

We can rewrite the identity in the form \\[ \\left(x-a_{1}\\right)\\left(x-a_{2}\\right)\\left(x-a_{3}\\right) \\cdots\\left(x-a_{2 k}\\right)=p^{2}(x)-1, \\] or, \\[ \\left(x-x_{1}\\right)\\left(x-a_{2}\\right)\\left(x-a_{3}\\right) \\cdots\\left(x-a_{2 k}\\right)=[p(x)+1][p(x)-1] . \\] Now, the product of the two polynomials \\(p(x)+1\\) and \\(p(x)-1\\) vanishes for \\(x=a_{1}, x=a_{2}, \\cdots, x=a_{2 k}\\). Consequently, for each of these values of \\(x\\) at least one of these polynomials vanishes, which means that either \\(p(x)+1\\) or else \\(p(x)-1\\) (or both) is divisible by \\(x-a_{1}\\) and this conclusion holds also for divisibility by \\(x-a_{2} x-a_{3}\\), and so on. Since a polynomial of degree \\(k\\) cannot be divisible by the product of more than \\(k\\) factors of form \\(x-a_{i}\\), and since the polynomial \\(p(x)+1\\) of degree \\(k\\), with leading coefficient 1 , is divisible by \\(k\\) factors of form \\(x-a_{i}\\), it follows that this polynomial is identically equal to this product. That is, \\(p(x)+1\\) is the product of \\(k\\) of the factors \\(x-a_{1}, x-a_{2}, \\cdots, x-a_{2 k}\\), and \\(p(x)-1\\) is the product of the remaining \\(k\\) factors. We may assume, with generality, that \\[ \\begin{aligned} & p(x)+1=\\left(x-a_{1}\\right)\\left(x-a_{3}\\right) \\cdots\\left(x-a_{2 k-1}\\right), \\\\ & p(x)-1=\\left(x-a_{2}\\right)\\left(x-a_{4}\\right) \\cdots\\left(x-a_{2 k}\\right) . \\end{aligned} \\] If the second equation is subtracted from the first, we obtain \\[ 2=\\left(x-a_{1}\\right)\\left(x-a_{3}\\right) \\cdots\\left(x-a_{2 k-1}\\right)-\\left(x-a_{2}\\right)\\left(x-a_{4}\\right) \\cdots\\left(x-a_{2 k}\\right) . \\] Now, to consider a specific case, if we let \\(x=a_{2}\\), we obtain the factorization of the integer 2 as the product of \\(k\\) integral factors: \\[ 2=\\left(a_{2}-a_{1}\\right)\\left(a_{2}-a_{3}\\right) \\cdots\\left(a_{2}-a_{2 k-1}\\right) . \\] Since the integer 2 cannot be expressed as a product of more than three distinct integers [for example, \\(2=1 \\cdot(-1) \\cdot(-2)\\) ] it follows that \\(k \\leqq 3\\). But the condition \\(k=3\\) is impossible in (1). Assume, for example, that \\(k=3\\) and that \\(a_{1}<a_{3}<a_{5}\\); then \\(2=\\left(a_{2}-a_{1}\\right)\\left(a_{2}-a_{3}\\right)\\left(a_{2}-a_{5}\\right)\\), where \\(a_{2}-a_{1}>a_{2}-a_{3}>a_{2}-a_{5}\\), and hence \\(a_{2}-a_{1}=1, a_{2}-a_{3}=-1\\), and \\(a_{2}-a_{5}=-2\\). If we substitute \\(x=a_{4}\\) in the formula \\[ 2=\\left(x-a_{1}\\right)\\left(x-a_{3}\\right)\\left(x-a_{5}\\right)-\\left(x-a_{2}\\right)\\left(x-a_{4}\\right)\\left(x-a_{6}\\right), \\] we arrive at the other representation of the integer 2 as a product of three \"polynomials\": \\[ 2=\\left(a_{4}-a_{1}\\right)\\left(a_{4}-a_{3}\\right)\\left(a_{4}-a_{5}\\right), \\] where also \\(a_{4}-a_{1}>a_{4}-a_{3}>a_{4}-a_{5}\\). It follows that \\(a_{4}-a_{1}=1\\), \\(a_{4}-a_{3}=-1\\), and \\(a_{4}-a_{5}=-2\\), which implies that \\(a_{4}=a_{2}\\), which contradicts the conditions of the problem. Hence only two cases are possible: \\(k=2\\) and \\(k=1\\). If \\(k=1\\), we have \\[ 2=\\left(x-a_{1}\\right)-\\left(x-a_{2}\\right), \\] which implies that \\(a_{2}=a_{1}+2\\), and if we designate \\(a_{2}\\) simply by \\(a\\), we have \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left(x-a_{1}\\right)\\left(x-a_{2}\\right)+1 & =(x-a)(x-a-2)+1 \\\\ & =(x-a-1)^{2} \\end{aligned} \\] (compare with the solution of problem 208). If \\(k=2\\), we have \\[ 2=\\left(x-a_{1}\\right)\\left(x-a_{3}\\right)-\\left(x-a_{2}\\right)\\left(x-a_{4}\\right), \\] where we will consider \\(a_{1}<a_{3}\\) and \\(a_{2}<a_{4}\\).

{"problem": "Prove that in a triangle whose sides have integral length it is not possible to find angles differing from \\(60^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ}\\), and \\(120^{\\circ}\\), and commensurable with a right angle.", "solution": "We make use of the fact that in a triangle with integral sides \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\) the number \\(2 \\cos A=\\frac{b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}}{b c}\\) (law of cosines, where \\(A\\) is the angle between \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) ) is rational.

Many of the problems in other sections of this book also deal with number theory-particularly Sections 3,4 , and 5 . Several of the following theorems, stated here as problems, play an important role in number theory (see, for example, problems \\(240,241,245\\) \\(247,249,253\\) ). Clearly, these problems do not pretend to explore with any completeness the rich variety of methods and ideas that have permeated this discipline, which is at once one of the most fruitful and one of the most difficult of all mathematical endeavors. A good systematic account of some parts of number theory is given in the book by B. B. Dynkin and V. A. Uspensky, Mathematical Conversations, Issue 6, Library of the USSR Mathematical Society. There the reader will find alternate solutions to some of the problems of this section. An excellent condensed treatment is the article by A. Y. Khinchin, \"Elementary Number Theory,\" appearing in the Encyclopedia of Elementary Mathematics, Government Technical Publishing House, Moscow, 1951, which contains, as an appendix, an extensive bibliography covering the topics touched on in the article.", "solution": "(a) Let us assume that the ratio of \\(\\theta=\\arccos \\frac{1}{p}\\) to \\(180^{\\circ}\\) is a rational number, that is, that \\(\\theta=\\frac{m}{n} \\cdot 180^{\\circ}\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are integers (which will be considered relatively prime). From the second formula of problem 222 (b) we have \\[ \\sin n \\theta=C_{n}^{1} \\cos ^{n-1} \\theta \\sin \\theta-C_{n}^{3} \\cos ^{n-3} \\theta \\sin ^{3} \\theta+C_{n}^{5} \\cos ^{n-5} \\theta \\sin ^{5} \\theta-\\cdots . \\] In the case of interest to us we have \\[ \\begin{aligned} & \\cos \\theta=\\frac{1}{p}, \\\\ & \\sin \\theta=\\sqrt{1-\\cos ^{2} \\theta}=\\frac{\\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}{p}, \\end{aligned} \\] and \\(\\sin m \\theta=\\sin 180^{\\circ} m=0\\). Substituting these values into the last equality, we obtain \\[ \\begin{aligned} 0=\\frac{\\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}{p^{n}}[n- & \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3 !}\\left(p^{2}-1\\right) \\\\ & \\left.\\quad+\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)}{5 !}\\left(p^{2}-1\\right)^{2}-\\cdots\\right] . \\end{aligned} \\] Since \\(p \\neq 1\\), we have \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}{p^{n}}, \\neq 0\\), and therefore the sum within brackets must be equal to zero. Since all the terms of this sum, except the first, are even integers ( \\(p^{2}-1\\) is even, since \\(p\\) is odd), the first term must also be even. Hence \\(n\\) is even, \\(n=2 k\\), and therefore \\(m\\) is odd. Since \\(m\\) is odd, it follows that \\[ \\cos k \\theta=\\cos \\frac{m \\theta}{2}=\\cos \\frac{m}{2} \\pi=0 . \\] From the first formula of problem 222 (b) we have \\[ \\cos k \\theta=\\cos ^{k} \\theta-C_{k}^{2} \\cos ^{k-2} \\theta \\sin ^{2} \\theta+C_{k}^{4} \\cos ^{k-4} \\theta \\sin ^{4} \\theta-\\cdots . \\] By setting \\(\\cos \\theta=\\frac{1}{p}, \\sin \\theta=\\frac{\\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}{p}\\), and \\(\\cos k \\theta=0\\) we obtain \\[ 0=\\frac{1}{p^{k}}\\left[1-C_{k}^{2}\\left(p^{2}-1\\right)+C_{k}^{4}\\left(p^{2}-1\\right)^{2}-\\cdots\\right] . \\] Here all the summands in the brackets, except the first, are even integers, and the first is equal to unity, that is, is odd. Therefore, the resulting equality is impossible. This contradiction proves that the ratio of \\(\\theta=\\arccos \\frac{1}{p}\\) to \\(180^{\\circ}\\) cannot be a rational number. (b) Let us assume that \\(\\theta=\\arctan \\frac{p}{q}\\) contains a rational number of degrees, that is, that \\(\\theta\\) can be expressed as \\(\\theta=\\frac{m}{n} 180^{\\circ}\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are integers. We shall consider \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) relatively prime, which is permissible, since we are interested only in the ratio \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) We shall use the DeMoivre formulas \\[ (\\cos \\theta+i \\sin \\theta)^{n}=\\cos n \\theta+i \\sin n \\theta \\] and \\[ (\\cos \\theta-i \\sin \\theta)^{n}=\\cos n \\theta-i \\sin n \\theta \\text {. } \\] Since \\(\\theta=\\frac{m}{n} 180^{\\circ}\\), we have \\(\\sin n \\theta=\\sin 180^{\\circ} m=0\\), and, consequently, \\[ (\\cos \\theta+i \\sin \\theta)^{n}=(\\cos \\theta-i \\sin \\theta)^{n} . \\] Dividing both sides of this equality by \\(\\cos ^{n} \\theta(\\cos \\theta \\neq 0\\), since \\(\\tan \\theta=\\) \\(\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}=\\frac{p}{q}\\), where \\(\\left.q \\neq 0\\right)\\), we obtain \\[ (1+i \\tan \\theta)^{n}=(1-i \\tan \\theta)^{n} \\] that is, \\[ \\left(1+i \\frac{p}{q}\\right)^{n}=\\left(1-i \\frac{p}{q}\\right)^{n} \\] or, after multiplying by \\(q^{n}\\), \\[ (q+i p)^{n}=(q-i p)^{n} \\] We shall now show that this equality is impossible when \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are integers, relatively prime, \\(p \\neq 0, q \\neq 0\\), and \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are not simultaneously equal to \\(\\pm 1\\). To this end we express the equality as \\[ \\begin{aligned} (q-i p)^{n}= & {[(q-i p)+2 i p]^{n} } \\\\ = & (q-i p)^{n}+C_{n}^{1}(q-i p)^{n-1} 2 i p+C_{n}^{2}(q-i p)^{n-2}(2 i p)^{2}+\\cdots \\\\ & +C_{n}^{n-1}(q-i p)(2 i p)^{n-1}+(2 i p)^{n} . \\end{aligned} \\] Eliminating the term \\((q-i p)^{n}\\) from the left and the right sides, dividing by \\(2 i p\\), and transposing \\((2 i p)^{n-1}\\) to the left side, we obtain \\[ \\begin{aligned} -(2 i p)^{n-1}=(q-i p) & {\\left[C_{n}^{1}(q-i p)^{n-2}+\\right.} \\\\ & \\left.C_{n}^{2}(q-i p)^{n-3} 2 i p+\\cdots+C_{n}^{n-1}(2 i p)^{n-2}\\right] . \\end{aligned} \\] Each side of this equality is a complex number; by equating the moduli of these complex numbers and taking into account the fact that the modulus of the product equals the product of the moduli of the factors, we find \\[ (2 p)^{2 n-2}=\\left(q^{2}+p^{2}\\right) B, \\] where \\(B\\) is the modulus of the expression within the brackets on the right side of the preceding equality. Thus \\(B\\) is equal to the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the number, \\[ C_{n}^{1}(q-i p)^{n-2}+C_{n}^{2}(q-i p)^{n-3} 2 i p+\\cdots+C_{n}^{n-1}(2 i p)^{n-2}, \\] and is therefore an integer. Thus \\((2 p)^{2 n-2}\\) is divisible by \\(p^{2}+q^{2}\\). But since \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are relatively prime, \\(p^{2}+q^{2}\\) does not have common factors with \\(p\\) and \\(q\\); that is, \\(2^{2 n-2}\\) must be divisible by \\(p^{2}+q^{2}\\). The numbers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are either both odd, or one is even and the other odd. If one is even and the other odd, then \\(p^{2}+q^{2}\\) will be odd, but if \\(p=2 r+1\\) and \\(q=2 s+1\\) (both odd), then \\[ p^{2}+q^{2}=2\\left(2 r^{2}+2 r+2 s^{2}+2 s+1\\right) \\] will be even, but it will contain the odd factor \\(2\\left(r^{2}+r+s^{2}+s\\right)+1\\). This odd factor becomes unity only for \\(p= \\pm 1, q= \\pm 1\\). Therefore for all remaining cases \\(2^{2 n-2}\\) cannot be divisible by \\(p^{2}+q^{2}\\). That is, \\(\\theta=\\arctan \\frac{p}{q}\\) cannot contain a rational number of degrees.", "hints_and_answers": "(a) In the second formula of problem 222 (b) substitute \\(\\theta=\\) \\(\\frac{m}{n} 180^{\\circ}, \\cos \\theta=\\frac{1}{p}, \\sin \\theta=\\frac{\\sqrt{p^{2}-1}}{p}\\).

{"problem": "Fermat's Theorem. Prove that if \\(p\\) is a prime number, then the difference \\(a^{p}-a\\) is, for any integer \\(a\\), divisible by \\(p\\). Remark: Problems 27 (a)-(d) are special cases of this theorem.", "solution": "First Solution. Assume that \\(a\\) is not divisible by \\(p\\). Then the integers \\(a, 2 a, 3 a, \\cdots,(p-1) a\\) will also fail to be divisible by \\(p\\), and they will yield different remainders when divided by \\(p\\) [if \\(k a\\) and \\(l a(p-1 \\geqq k>l)\\) produced identical remainders when divided by \\(p\\), then the difference \\(k a-l a=(k-l) a\\) would be divisible by \\(p\\), which is impossible, since \\(p\\) is prime, \\(a\\) is not divisible by \\(p\\), and \\(k-l\\) is less than \\(p\\).] But since, upon division by \\(p\\), all possible remainders are exhausted by the \\(p-1\\) numbers \\(1,2,3, \\cdots, p-1\\), it necessarily follows that \\[ \\begin{aligned} a & =q_{1} p+a_{1}, \\\\ 2 a & =q_{2} p+a_{2}, \\\\ 3 a & =q_{3} p+a_{3}, \\\\ \\cdots & \\cdots \\cdots \\cdots, \\\\ (p-1) a & =q_{p-1} p+a_{p-1}, \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{p-1}\\) are the positive integers \\(1,2, \\cdots, p-1\\), taken in some order. Multiplying together all these equalities, we obtain \\[ \\begin{gathered} {[1 \\cdot 2 \\cdots(p-1)] a^{p-1}=N p+a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{p-1}} \\\\ {[1 \\cdot 2 \\cdots(p-1)]\\left(a^{p-1}-1\\right)=N p} \\end{gathered} \\] Therefore it follows that \\(a^{p-1}-1\\) is divisible by \\(p\\), and \\(a^{p}-a\\) is also divisible by \\(p\\). (If \\(a\\) is initially divisible by \\(p\\), then the assertion of Fermat's theorem is obvious.) Second Solution. The theorem is obvious for \\(a=1\\), since in that case \\(a^{p}-a=1-1=0\\). We shall now apply mathematical induction to the positive integer \\(a\\), and show that if \\(a^{p}-a\\) is divisible by \\(p\\), then it will follow that \\((a+1)^{p}-(a+1)\\) is divisible by \\(p\\). By use of the binomial theorem we find that \\[ \\begin{aligned} (a+1)^{p}-(a+1) & =a^{p}+p a^{p-1}+C_{p}^{2} a^{p-2}+C_{p}^{3} a^{p-3}+\\cdots+p a+1-a-1 \\\\ & =\\left(a^{p}-a\\right)+p a^{p-1}+C_{p}^{2} a^{p-2}+\\cdots+C_{p}^{p-2} a^{2}+p a . \\end{aligned} \\] But all the binomial coefficients \\[ C_{p}^{k}=\\frac{p(p-1)(p-2) \\cdots(p-k+1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots k} \\] are divisible by the prime number \\(p\\), since \\(C_{p}^{k}\\) is an integer and since the numerator of the above expression for \\(C_{p}^{k}\\) contains the factor \\(p\\) whereas the denominator does not contain this factor. But since, by the induction hypothesis, \\(a^{p}-a\\) is also divisible by \\(p\\), it follows that \\((a+1)^{p}-(a+1)\\) is divisible by \\(p\\). We shall detail a more elegant variation of the same proof. Because all the binomial coefficients \\(C_{p}^{k}\\) are divisible by \\(p\\), the difference \\[ \\begin{aligned} & (A+B)^{p}-A^{p}-B^{p} \\\\ & \\quad=p A^{p-1} B+C_{p}^{2} A^{p-2} B^{2}+\\cdots+C_{p}^{p-2} A^{2} B^{p-2}+p A B^{p-2} \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are any integers, is always divisible by \\(p\\). If we apply this result, we find that \\[ \\begin{aligned} & (A+B+C)^{p}-A^{p}-B^{p}-C^{p} \\\\ & \\quad=\\left\\{[(A+B)+C]^{p}-(A+B)^{p}-C^{p}\\right\\}+(A+B)^{p}-A^{p}-B^{p} \\end{aligned} \\] is always divisible by \\(p\\); that \\[ \\begin{aligned} (A+B+C+D)^{p}-A^{p}- & B^{p}-C^{p}-D^{p} \\\\ = & \\left\\{[(A+B+C)+D]^{p}-(A+B+C)^{p}-D^{p}\\right\\} \\\\ & +(A+B+C)^{p}-A^{p}-B^{p}-C^{p} \\end{aligned} \\] is always divisible by \\(p\\); and that, in general, \\[ (A+B+C+\\cdots+K)^{p}-A^{p}-B^{p}-C^{p}-\\cdots-K^{p} \\] is always divisible by \\(p\\). If in the last expression we now set \\(A=B=C=\\cdots=K=1\\), and if we let the number of these terms be equal to \\(a\\), we arrive at Fermat's theorem: \\(a^{p}-a\\) is divisible by \\(p\\).", "hints_and_answers": "Use the fact that if \\(a\\) is not divisible by \\(p\\), then the numbers \\(a, 2 a, 3 a, \\cdots,(p-1) a\\) all yield different remainders when divided by \\(p\\)."}

In fact, the square of every even number may be expressed as \\(4 k\\), and the square of an odd number may be expressed as \\(4 k+1\\), since \\[ (2 a+1)^{2}=4\\left(a^{2}+a\\right)+1 . \\] Accordingly, the sum of the squares of two even numbers may have the form \\(4 n\\); the sum of the squares of two odd numbers may have the form \\(4 n+2\\); and finally, the sum of the squares of an even and an odd number may have the form \\(4 n+1\\).

If \\(m=1\\), the proof is completed. Hence we shall assume that \\(m \\neq 1\\). Now, if \\(m\\) is even, then \\(x^{2}+1\\) is even, whence \\(x\\) must be odd.

Thus we obtain \\[ n p=\\left(\\frac{x x_{1}+y y_{1}}{m}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{x y_{1}-x_{1} y}{m}\\right)^{2} \\] which displays \\(n p\\) as the sum of squares. If, now, \\(n=1\\), we are finished. If \\(n \\neq 1\\), we can, by using exactly the same method, decrease this number, that is, find an \\(n_{1}<n\\) such that \\(n_{1} p\\) can be expressed as the sum of the squares of two integers. If \\(n_{1}\\) fails to be 1 , we can find an \\(n_{2}<n_{1}\\) such that \\(n_{2} p\\) may be expressed as the sum of the squares of two integers. Continuation of this process produces a strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers for \\(n_{i}\\), which must terminate with 1 . Therefore, the number \\(1 \\cdot p\\) can be expressed as the sum of the squares of two integers: \\[ p=X^{2}+Y^{2}, \\] as was to be shown. (c) First, it follows almost immediately from the theorems in problems (a) and (b) that if a composite number \\(N\\) contains prime factors of the form \\(4 n+3\\), but only even powers of them, then \\(N\\) can be expressed as the sum of the squares of two integers.

{"problem": "Prove that, for any prime \\(p\\), it is possible to find integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(x^{2}+y^{2}+1\\) is divisible by \\(p\\).", "solution": "For \\(p=2\\) we have, trivially, \\(2=1^{2}+0^{2}+1\\). For an odd prime \\(p\\) we shall give a constructive method for finding two numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), both less than \\(\\frac{p}{2}\\), which satisfy the condition of the problem.

In fact, the equations \\[ \\begin{aligned} & x_{1}^{2}=k_{1} p+r, \\\\ & x_{2}^{2}=k_{2} p+r \\end{aligned} \\] would imply that \\[ x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}=\\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\\right)\\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\\right)=\\left(k_{1}-k_{2}\\right) p . \\] That is, \\[ \\left(x_{1}-x_{2}\\right)\\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\\right) \\] would be divisible by \\(p\\), which is impossible since \\(x_{1}<\\frac{p}{2}\\) and \\(x_{2}<\\) \\(\\frac{p}{2}\\), and so \\[ \\begin{aligned} x_{1}+x_{2} & <p, \\\\ \\left|x_{1}-x_{2}\\right| & <p \\end{aligned} \\] (remember that \\(p\\) is a prime number). Hence the numbers of the set \\(0^{2}, 1^{2}, 2^{2}, \\cdots,\\left(\\frac{p-1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\) yield \\(\\frac{p+1}{2}\\) distinct (nonnegative) remainders when divided by \\(p\\).

Remark: Since the identity just displayed is rather involved, let us note its relationship to the simpler identity in problem 247 (a). The identity in problem 247 (a) may be generalized in the following manner: \\[ \\left(a a^{\\prime}+b b^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(a_{1} a_{1}^{\\prime}+b_{1} b_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left(a a_{1}^{\\prime}+b b_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)\\left(a_{1} a^{\\prime}+b_{1} b^{\\prime}\\right)+\\left(a b_{1}-b a_{1}\\right)\\left(a^{\\prime} b_{1}^{\\prime}-b^{\\prime} a_{1}^{\\prime}\\right) . \\] If in the last identity we now set \\[ \\begin{aligned} a & =x_{1}+i x_{2}, & & a_{1}=y_{1}+i y_{2}, \\\\ a^{\\prime} & =x_{1}-i x_{2}, & & a_{1}^{\\prime}=y_{1}-i y_{2}, \\\\ b & =x_{3}+i x_{4}, & & b_{1}=y_{3}+i y_{4}, \\\\ b^{\\prime} & =x_{3}-i x_{4}, & & b_{1}^{\\prime}=y_{3}-i y_{4}, \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(i=\\sqrt{-1}\\), then we arrive at the identity of the present problem. The quotient \\(q\\) and the (nonnegative) remainder \\(r\\) resulting upon the \\(\\mathrm{di}\\) vision of a positive or a negative integer \\(a\\) by \\(p\\) are determined by the formula \\(a=q p+r\\), where \\(0 \\leqq r<p\\), and the quotient \\(q\\) is negative for negative \\(a\\). (b) Since each integer may be expressed as a product of prime numbers, the result of problem (a) reduces this problem to showing that every prime number \\(p\\) may be expressed as the sum of the squares of four integers. The proof of this proposition is completely analogous to the solution of problem 247 (b). We know, from the result of problem 248, that there exists a number \\(m\\) such that \\(m p\\) may be expressed as the sum of the squares of at most four integers: \\[ m p=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+x_{4}^{2} \\] (we can consider \\(x_{3}=1\\) and \\(x_{4}=0\\), although we do not need that information). We can further consider \\(m<p\\) (see the remarks on the solution of problem 248). We shall show that if \\(m>1\\), then \\(m\\) can be reduced; that is, we can always find some number \\(n<m\\) such that \\(n p\\) can also be expressed as the sum of at most four squares. This proof is straightforward if \\(m\\) is even, since in that case \\[ m p=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+x_{4}^{2} \\] is even, and either all \\(x_{k}(k=1,2,3,4)\\) are even, or two of them are odd and the other two even, or they are all odd. In every case the four numbers \\(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\\), and \\(x_{4}\\) can be grouped into two pairs (say, \\(x_{1} ; x_{2}\\) and \\(x_{3}, x_{4}\\) ), each pair consisting of two even or two odd numbers. Then the numbers \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}, & \\frac{x_{3}+x_{4}}{2}, \\\\ \\frac{x_{1}-x_{2}}{2}, & \\frac{x_{3}-x_{4}}{2} \\end{array} \\] will be integers, and we will have \\[ \\frac{m}{2} \\cdot p=\\left(\\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{x_{1}-x_{2}}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{x_{3}+x_{4}}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{x_{3}-x_{4}}{2}\\right)^{2} . \\] That is, the number \\(\\frac{m}{2} \\cdot p\\) can also be expressed as the sum of the squares of at most four integers. The case where \\(m\\) is odd is more involved. Let us substitute \\(y_{k}\\) \\((k=1,2,3,4)\\) for the remainder, smallest in absolute value, which can appear when \\(x_{k}\\) is divided by \\(m\\) (if when \\(x_{k}\\) is divided by \\(m\\) there is a positive remainder greater than \\(\\frac{m}{2}\\), then we increase the quotient by 1 and show a negative remainder, whose magnitude is then \\(\\left.<\\frac{m}{2}\\right)\\) : \\[ x_{k}=m q_{k}+y_{k} \\quad(k=1,2,3,4), \\] where \\(y_{k}\\) is a positive or negative integer and \\(\\left|y_{k}\\right|<\\frac{m}{2}\\) (none of the integers \\(y_{k}\\) can have magnitude \\(\\frac{m}{2}\\), since \\(m\\) is odd). We now have \\[ x_{k}^{2}=m^{2} q_{k}^{2}+2 m q_{k} y_{k}+y_{k}^{2}=m Q_{k}+y_{k}^{2} \\quad(k=1,2,3,4) \\] where \\(Q_{k}=m q_{k}^{2}+2 q_{k} y_{k}\\) is an integer. Therefore, \\[ m p=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+x_{4}^{2}=m q+y_{1}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}+y_{3}^{2}+y_{4}^{2} \\] (here \\(q=Q_{1}+Q_{2}+Q_{3}+Q_{4}\\) ) and \\[ y_{1}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}+y_{3}^{2}+y_{4}^{2}=m n \\] (here \\(n=p-q\\) ). In this connection \\(n<m\\), since \\[ m n=y_{1}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}+y_{3}^{2}+y_{4}^{2}<4\\left(\\frac{m}{2}\\right)^{2}=m^{2}, \\] moreover, \\(n \\neq 0\\), since otherwise all \\(x_{k}\\) would be divisible by \\(m\\) and \\(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+x_{4}^{2}=m p\\) would necessarily be divisible by \\(m^{2}\\), which is impossible, since \\(p\\) is prime and \\(m\\) is different from 1 and less than \\(p\\). We now show that the number \\(n p\\) also can be expressed as the sum of not more than four squares. We shall see that each of the numbers \\(m p\\) and \\(m n\\) can be expressed as the sum of not more than four squares. From the identity proven in problem (a), it follows that the product \\[ m p \\cdot m n=m^{2} n p \\] may also be expressed as the sum of the squares of four numbers: \\[ \\begin{aligned} m^{2} n p= & \\left(x_{1} y_{1}+x_{2} y_{2}+x_{3} y_{3}+x_{4} y_{4}\\right)^{2} \\\\ & +\\left(x_{1} y_{2}-x_{2} y_{1}+x_{3} y_{4}-x_{4} y_{3}\\right)^{2} \\\\ & +\\left(x_{1} y_{3}-x_{3} y_{1}+x_{2} y_{4}-x_{4} y_{2}\\right)^{2} \\\\ & +\\left(x_{1} y_{4}-x_{4} y_{1}+x_{2} y_{3}-x_{3} y_{2}\\right)^{2} \\end{aligned} \\] We shall show that both sides of the last equality may be divided by \\(m^{2}\\). Let us substitute on the right side of the equality \\(m q_{k}+y_{k}\\) for all \\(x_{k}\\). We see that all the expressions in parentheses on the right side of the equality are divisible by \\(m\\) : the expression in the first set of parentheses is divisible by \\(m\\), since \\(y_{1}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}+y_{3}^{2}+y_{4}^{2}=m n\\) is divisible by \\(m\\), and the expressions in the remaining three sets of parentheses are divisible by \\(m\\) because after the substitution \\(x_{k}=m q_{k}+y_{k}\\) all the products of the form \\(y_{1} y_{2}\\), and so on, cancel. Now if we divide the last equality by \\(m^{2}\\), we obtain \\[ n p=z_{1}^{2}+z_{2}^{2}+z_{3}^{2}+z_{4}^{2}, \\] as was to be shown. Thus, if the number \\(m\\) in the equation \\[ m p=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+x_{1}^{2} \\] is not equal to 1 , it can always be decreased; that is, there will always be a positive \\(n<m\\) for which a similar equality exists. If \\(n \\neq 1\\), we can still decrease the number \\(n\\). In this way we obtain a strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers \\(m>n>n_{1}>\\cdots\\) until in at most a finite number of steps we obtain \\[ p=X_{1}^{2}+X_{2}^{2}+X_{3}^{2}+X_{4}^{2} . \\]", "hints_and_answers": "(a) Show that the product \\[ \\left(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+x_{4}^{2}\\right)\\left(y_{1}^{2}+y_{2}^{2}+y_{3}^{2}+y_{4}^{2}\\right) \\] can be represented as a sum of squares of four polynomials. (b) The solution is similar to that of problem 247 (see the hint to that problem). Instead of using the proposition of problem 246 in that solution, we must use that of problem 248."}

{"problem": "Prove that every positive integer can be written as the sum of not more than 53 fourth powers of integers.

It has been conjectured that 19 fourth powers suffice for every integer, but no proof of this has as yet appeared. The best result in this direction has been the proof that every natural number can be written as the sum of not more than 21 fourth powers.

We may choose any desired \\(\\vec{Y}\\) in the formulas. (This circumstance is analogous to that where we simplify the equation \\(x^{3}+y^{3}+z^{3}=a\\) using the relation \\(y=-z\\); then the unknown \\(z\\) may be chosen arbitrarily.

In that case \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) remain close to \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\sqrt[3]{3 a}\\) and to \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\sqrt[3]{3 a}\\), respectively (they remain positive).

This cancludes the proof of the theorem. For example, consider the case \\(a=\\frac{2}{3}\\). By setting \\(\\bar{Y}=1\\) in the formulas we can easily obtain \\[ \\begin{aligned} & x=\\frac{5}{9} \\\\ & y=\\frac{1}{18} \\\\ & z=\\frac{5}{6} \\end{aligned} \\] in fact, \\[ \\left(\\frac{5}{9}\\right)^{3}+\\left(\\frac{1}{18}\\right)^{3}+\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{3}=\\frac{2}{3} . \\]", "hints_and_answers": "The idea of the solution is as follows.

If we assume that two of these unknowns are functionally related in some way, then the equation may be greatly simplified-for example, if we let \\(y=-z\\), then we have simply \\(x^{3}=a\\). From the simplified equation it is sometimes possible to express one of the unknowns in terms of \\(a\\); in this instance, for example, we obtained \\(x=\\sqrt[3]{a}\\). Here \\(x\\) is irrational, which will generally be the case with such a procedure. We must try to find a functional dependence between two of the unknowns such that the third unknown comes out of the simplified equation with rational value (without the radical). If this can be done, it remains only to find suitable rational solutions for the two other unknowns, and these are related by the function which was set up between them. To do this, it is convenient to change the unknowns \\(x, y\\), and \\(z\\) to new unknowns. For the determination of the new variables, it is useful to begin with the identity of problem 162 (b)."}
{"problem": "Prove that there exists an infinite number of prime numbers.", "solution": "It follows from the result of problem 159 that there must be an infinite number of prime numbers.

However, the proof of this theorem is quite complicated.

Prior to this the only known proofs involved higher mathematics). \\section*{SOME DISTINCTIVE INEQUALITIES} This section presents several problems relating to inequalities stemming from two important inequalities which play a major role in mathematical analysis and in geometry. These are the theorem relating arithmetic and geometric means (problem 268), and the so-called Cauchy-Buniakowski inequality (problem 289). Many problems on inequalities, not related to these two but of importance in other applications, appear in other sections of this book (see, in particular, Sections 6 and 7). A great many interesting inequalities may be found in the Problem Book in Algebra, by V. A. Kretchmer, Government Technical Publishing House, Moscow, 1950 , where an entire chapter is devoted to inequalities. That book offers alternative proofs of several of the inequalities presented here. There is also much interesting material in the books by P. P. Korovkin, Inequalities (Government Technical Publishing House, Moscow, 1951), by G. L. Nevyashy, Inequalities (Pedagogical Publishing House, Moscow, 1947), and particularly that by Hardy, Littlewood, and Polya, Inequalities, (Government Technical Publishing House, Moscow, 1949). \\({ }^{.}\\) The initial chapters of the last book may be read by persons not acquainted with higher mathematics: The following problems are not presented in order of increasing difficulty. t The last book was originally written in English. It is published by Cambridge University Press, revised edition, [Editor]. The ordering is such that in some instances the result of one problem will be useful in solving the next; in other instances problems conceptually related are grouped together. The simplest properties of inequalities are assumed known. In all the problems of this section, small English letters designate real numbers. \\section*{Theorems on Arithmetic and Geometric Means and Their Applications} We know, from formal mathematics courses, that the geometric mean of two positive numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is less than, or equal to, their arithmetic mean, \\[ \\sqrt{a b} \\leqq \\frac{a+b}{2} \\] and the equality holds only if \\(a=b\\). This is proved as follows. If we square both members of the inequality and clear of fractions, we arrive at \\[ 4 a b \\leqq(a+b)^{2} \\] Expanding the right member, transposing \\(4 a b\\) to the right side, and so on, we obtain \\[ 0 \\leqq a^{2}-2 a b+b^{2}=(a-b)^{2} \\] which clearly is true for all numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), since the square of any real number is nonnegative. Hence, inequality (1) holds for every real number. Moreover, it is evident that \\((a-b)^{2}\\) can be zero only if \\(a=b\\); that is, the last inequality reduces to the equality only for \\(a=b\\). Therefore, this criterion must hold also for inequality (1). Inequality (1) may be rewritten in the following equivalent form, which we shall use hereafter: \\[ \\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)^{2} \\leqq \\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}}{2} \\] If we expand the left member of \\(\\left(1^{\\prime}\\right)\\), clear of fractions and put all terms in the right member, we obtain \\[ 0 \\leqq 2 a^{2}+2 b^{2}-\\left(a^{2}+2 a b+b^{2}\\right)=(a-b)^{2} . \\] Use of inequalities (1) and \\(\\left(1^{\\prime}\\right)\\) simplifies the solution of the first of the problems which follow. These two forms of the inequality are useful in the derivation of many generalizations, the most important of which are the propositions of problems 268 and 283. The arithmetic mean of \\(n\\) positive numbers \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n}\\) is defined by the following expression: \\[ A_{n}(a)=\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n} . \\] The geometric mean of \\(n\\) positive numbers \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n}\\) is defined as the \\(n\\)th root of their product: \\[ \\Gamma_{n}(a)=\\sqrt[n]{a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{n}} \\] Finally, the harmonic mean of \\(n\\) positive numbers is the number \\(H(a)\\) such that \\[ \\frac{1}{H(a)}=\\frac{1 / a+1 / a_{2}+\\cdots+1 / a_{n}}{n} \\] (the reciprocal of the harmonic mean of \\(n\\) numbers is the arithmetic mean of the numbers inverse to the given ones). In particular, the harmonic mean of two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is determined by the equation \\[ \\frac{1}{c}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}\\right) \\] from which \\(c=2 a b /(a+b)\\).", "solution": "(a) The proof given here will be quite similar to Euclid's proof of the existence of an infinite number of primes. The integers comprising the first sequence given in the problem are all those of form \\(4 k-1\\). Assume that only a finite number of primes appear in the sequence, that is, \\(3,7,11,19,23, \\cdots, p_{n}\\). Consider the number \\[ N=4\\left(3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 23 \\cdots p_{n}\\right)-1 . \\] This integer exceeds every prime which appears in the given progression, and so, being a number of form \\(4 k-1\\) (hence belonging to the progression), it must be composite. Factor \\(N\\) into its prime factors. none of these factors can be of form \\(4 k-1\\), since \\(N+1=\\) \\(4\\left(3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 19 \\cdots p_{n}\\right)\\) is divisible by all primes of form \\(4 k-1\\), and, consequently, \\(N\\) is relatively prime to all these numbers. Since \\(N\\) is odd, it must then be representable as the product of primes of form \\(4 k+1\\). This is impossible, since the product of numbers of form \\(4 k+1\\) is again a number of this same form, \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left(4 k_{1}+1\\right)\\left(4 k_{2}+1\\right) & =16 k_{1} k_{2}+4 k_{1}+4 k_{2}+1 \\\\ & =4\\left(4 k_{1} k_{2}+k_{1}+k_{2}\\right)+1=4 k_{3}+1 \\end{aligned} \\] and \\(N\\) is of form \\(4 k-1\\). Thus the assumption that there is a finite number of integers of form \\(4 k-1\\) produces a contradiction. Hence the number of primes in the given sequence must be infinite. The proof for the second sequence, which contains all the integers of form \\(6 k-1\\), is quite analogous. (b) The proof of this problem is based on the same idea as that just presented in part (a). Assume that the sequence 5,9,13, \\(17,21,25, \\cdots\\) contains only a finite number of primes: \\(5,13,17, \\cdots\\), \\(p_{n}\\). Consider the number \\[ N=\\left(5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 17 \\cdots p_{n}\\right)^{2}+1 . \\] The number \\(N\\) is clearly not a perfect square (it is one more than a square). However, \\(N\\) is the sum of two squares; from problem 247 (b) it follows that \\(N\\) can only be of form \\(4 k+1\\) (no number of form \\(4 k-1\\) can be expressed as the sum of two squares). From this point the method of proof is analogous to that used in problem 253 or 254 (a). (c) The proof is somewhat more complicated than the proofs of parts (a) and (b), although it is still based on the same idea. Assume that in the sequence \\(11,21,31,41,51,61, \\cdots\\) there exists only a finite number of primes: \\[ 11,31,41,61, \\cdots, p_{n} \\] Consider the integer \\(N=\\left(11 \\cdot 31 \\cdot 41 \\cdot 61 \\cdots p_{n}\\right)^{5}-1\\). This number is relatively prime to all the integers \\(11,31,41, \\cdots, p_{n}\\), since \\(N+1\\) is divisible by all these integers. We shall designate the product \\(11 \\cdot 31 \\cdot 41 \\cdots p_{n}\\) by \\(a\\). Then \\[ N=a^{5}-1=(a-1)\\left(a^{4}+a^{3}+a^{2}+a+1\\right) . \\] Let us investigate what factorization of \\(N\\) can produce a factor of \\(a^{4}+a^{3}+a^{2}+a+1\\). Clearly, \\(a^{4}+a^{3}+a^{2}+a+1\\) is not divisible by 2 (it is the sum of five odd numbers). Further, \\(a^{4}+a^{3}+a^{2}+a+1\\) is divisible by 5 , inasmuch as \\(a\\) itself terminates in the digit 1 ( \\(a\\) is a product of numbers all ending with \\(1 ; a^{2}, a^{3}\\), and \\(a^{4}\\) each end with the digit 1 , and so the sum \\(a^{4}+a^{3}+a^{2}+a+1\\) ends with the digit 5). Now let \\(p\\) be a prime divisor of \\(a^{4}+a^{3}+a^{2}+a+1\\) differing from 5. Here, \\(a-1\\) cannot be divisible by \\(p\\), since otherwise \\(a\\) would be of form \\(k p+1\\), and so \\(a^{2}, a^{3}\\), and \\(a^{4}\\) (which are equal, respectively, to \\((k p+1)^{2},(k p+1)^{3}\\), and \\(\\left.(k p+1)^{4}\\right)\\) would be of the same form, and the number \\(a^{4}+a^{3}+a^{2}+a+1=(k p+1)^{4}+(k p+1)^{3}+(k p+1)^{2}+(k p+1)+1\\) would yield a remainder of 5 upon division by \\(p\\). It follows that \\(p-1\\) must be divisible by 5 ; in fact, suppose that \\(p-1\\) yields the remainder 4 when divided by 5 : \\[ p-1=5 k+4 \\text {. } \\] We note (Fermat's theorem, problem 240 ) that \\(a^{p-1}-1\\) is divisible by \\(p\\). But in this case \\[ a^{p-1}-1=a^{5 k+4}-1=a^{4}\\left(a^{5 k}-1\\right)+\\left(a^{4}-1\\right), \\] and since \\(a^{5 k}-1=\\left(a^{5}\\right)^{k}-1^{k}\\) is divisible by \\(a^{5}-1\\), which means that it is divisible also by \\(p\\), it follows that \\(a^{4}-1\\) is divisible by \\(p\\). However, \\[ a^{5}-1=a\\left(a^{4}-1\\right)+(a-1) ; \\] consequently, if \\(a^{5}-1\\) and \\(a^{4}-1\\) are divisible by \\(p\\), then \\(a-1\\) also must be divisible by \\(p\\). This, as shown above, is impossible. It may be shown, in analogous fashion, that \\(p-1\\) cannot yield the remainders 1,2 , or 3 upon division by 5 . Thus, \\(p-1\\) is divisible by 5 and is an even number ( \\(p\\) being odd). Consequently, \\(p-1\\) is divisible by 10 , which means that \\(p\\) is of form \\(10 k+1\\); that is, it belongs to the given progression. Therefore, it is established that the prime divisors of the number \\(a^{4}+a^{3}+a^{2}+a+1\\) can be only 5 and prime numbers of form \\(10 k+1\\). However, the number \\(a^{4}+a^{3}+a^{2}+a+1\\) is obviously larger than 5 , and it is not divisible by \\(5^{2}=25\\). In fact, the integer \\(a\\) ends with the digit 1 and is consequently of form \\(5 k+1\\). Further, by the binomial theorem, we have \\[ \\begin{aligned} a^{4}+a^{3}+ & a^{2}+a+1 \\\\ = & (5 k+1)^{4}+(5 k+1)^{3}+(5 k+1)^{2}+5 k+1+1 \\\\ = & 625 k^{4}+4 \\cdot 125 k^{9}+6 \\cdot 25 k^{2}+4 \\cdot 5 k+1 \\\\ & +125 k^{3}+3 \\cdot 25 k^{2}+3 \\cdot 5 k+1 \\\\ & +25 k^{2}+2 \\cdot 5 k+1+5 k+1+1 \\\\ = & 625 k^{4}+5 \\cdot 125 k^{3}+10 \\cdot 25 k^{2}+10 \\cdot 5 k+5 \\\\ = & 5 \\cdot\\left[5\\left(25 k^{4}+25 k^{3}+10 k^{2}+2 k\\right)+1\\right] . \\end{aligned} \\] It follows that this number, and, consequently, \\(N=a^{5}-1\\), must have at least one prime divisor of form \\(10^{k}+1\\). But, as noted above, \\(N\\) is relatively prime to all prime numbers of form \\(10 k+1\\). This contradiction proves the theorem.

{"problem": "A butcher has an inaccurate balance scale (its beams are of unequal length). Knowing that it is inaccurate, and being an honest merchant, he weighs his meat as follows. He takes half of it and places it on one pan, and he places the weights on the other pan; then he weighs the other half of the meat by reversing this procedure, that is, by removing the weights and placing the meat on that pan. Thus, the butcher believes he is giving honest weight. Is his assumption correct?", "solution": "Let the lengths of the two beams of the scale be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), respectively. Then in order to balance a weight of 1 pound placed in one of the pans-say on the pan hung from the beam of length \\(a\\)-the butcher must place in the other pan an amount of meat weighing actually \\(x=\\frac{a}{b}\\) pounds (since the moments \\(a \\cdot 1\\) and \\(b \\cdot x\\) must be equal in order to produce equilibrium). Similarly, if a onepound weight is placed on the other pan, it will be balanced by \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\) pounds of meat. Therefore, the butcher gives out \\(\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}\\) pounds of meat, and this is weighed out as 2 pounds. However, \\(\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}>2\\) \\(\\left[\\right.\\) since \\(\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{b}{a}-2=\\frac{a^{2}-2 a b+b^{2}}{a b}=\\frac{(a-b)^{2}}{a b} \\geqq 0\\), and equality can hold only if \\(a=b]\\). This means that the butcher gives out more meat than he charges for. On the other hand, suppose the butcher sells his meat in the following way: A given piece is divided into two equal parts, and each part is weighed on a different pan. Let us assume (since other cases can be easily handled by similar reasoning) that the true weight of the whole is exactly 2 pounds; thus, each piece has true weight, by assumption, of 1 pound. When one piece of meat is placed on one of the pans, the total of the weights needed to balance it comes to \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) pounds, and when the other piece is placed on the other pan, the total of the weights needed to balance that piece comes to \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\) pounds. Thus in this case, the sum of the markings on the weights exceeds the total weight of the meat-that is the butcher is short-weighing his customers. Thus, whether the customer gains or the butcher gains depends upon the procedure used. The reader is invited to answer the equestion: Is a paradox involved here?

We show first that if the statement of the theorem concerning arithmetic and geometric means holds for \\(n+1\\) positive numbers, then it holds for \\(n\\) positive numbers. Assume that for any set of \\(n+1\\) positive numbers \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n}, a_{n+1}\\) \\[ \\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}+a_{n+1}}{n+1} \\geqq{ }^{n+1} \\sqrt{a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{n} a_{n+1}}, \\] or, \\[ \\left(\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}+a_{n+1}}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} \\geqq a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{n} a_{n+1} . \\] If we substitute into this inequality \\[ a_{n+1}=\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n}, \\] then we obtain \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}+a_{n+1}}{n+1} & =\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}+\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n}}{n+1} \\\\ = & \\frac{\\frac{n+1}{n}\\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots a_{n}\\right)}{n+1}=\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n} . \\end{aligned} \\] Consequently, we have \\[ \\left(\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n}\\right)^{n+1} \\geqq a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{n}\\left(\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n}\\right) . \\] If we cancel \\(\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n}\\) on both sides and take the \\(n\\)th root, we arrive at the desired result, \\[ \\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\geqq{ }^{n} \\sqrt{a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{n}} \\] But in view of the result of the preceding problem we know that the theorem of arithmetic and geometric means holds for arbitrarily large integers, in particular, for integers of form \\(2^{m}\\). Therefore, the theorem holds for arbitrary \\(n\\), since given any \\(n\\) it is dominated by some number \\(2^{m}\\), and, by what has just been shown, the theorem holds for \\(2^{m}-1,2^{m}-2\\), and so on, and thus for \\(n\\). Also, if for \\(n+1\\) numbers equality holds only if all the numbers are equal, then the same condition must clearly hold for \\(n\\) numbers. Since this condition for equality was shown necessary in problem 267 for \\(n=2^{m}\\), it also applies in this problem. Remark: This method of proof, which somewhat resembles that of mathematical induction, is sometimes called transfinite induction. It may be stated as follows: if the truth of the theorem for \\(n=k+1\\) implies that it holds for \\(n=k\\), and if, no matter what positive integer \\(n\\) is chosen, the theorem can always be demonstrated for some integer exceeding \\(n\\), then the theorem holds for all natural numbers \\(n\\). Second Proof (mathematical induction). For \\(n=2\\), we have \\[ \\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}}{2} \\geqq \\sqrt{a_{1} a_{2}} \\] Assume that the inequality of the problem has been proved for some number \\(n\\) of positive numbers; we shall show that it must hold for \\(n+1\\) positive numbers. Let \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n}, a_{n+1}\\) be \\(n+1\\) positive numbers, arranged such that \\(a_{n+1}\\) is the largest. Since \\[ \\begin{aligned} a_{n+1} & \\geqq a_{1}, \\\\ a_{n+1} & \\geqq a_{2}, \\cdots, a_{n+1} \\geqq a_{n}, \\end{aligned} \\] it follows that \\[ a_{n+1} \\geqq \\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\] We shall write \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n} & =A_{n}, \\\\ \\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}+a_{n+1}}{n+1} & =A_{n+1} . \\end{aligned} \\] Then \\[ A_{n+1}=\\frac{n A_{n}+a_{n+1}}{n+1} \\] But since \\(a_{n+1} \\geqq A_{n}\\), we can write \\(a_{n+1}=A_{n}+b\\), where \\(b \\geqq 0\\), then \\[ A_{n+1}=\\frac{n A_{n}+A_{n}+b}{n+1}=A_{n}+\\frac{b}{n+1} . \\] If both members of the last equation are raised to the \\((n+1)\\) st power we have \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left(A_{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} & =\\left(A_{n}+\\frac{b}{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} \\\\ & =\\left(A_{n}\\right)^{n+1}+C_{n+1}^{1}\\left(A_{n}\\right)^{n} \\frac{b}{n+1}+\\cdots \\\\ & \\geqq\\left(A_{n}\\right)^{n+1}+\\left(A_{n}\\right)^{n} b=\\left(A_{n}\\right)^{n}\\left(A_{n}+b\\right)=\\left(A_{n}\\right)^{n} a_{n+1} \\end{aligned} \\] Since, by the induction assumption, the inequality holds for \\(n\\) num. bers, that is, \\[ \\left(A_{n}\\right)^{n} \\geqq a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{n} \\] it follows that \\[ \\left(A_{n+1}\\right)^{n+1} \\geqq\\left(A_{n}\\right)^{n} a_{n+1} \\geqq a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{n} a_{n+1} \\] and, consequently, \\[ A_{n+1} \\geqq{ }^{n+1} \\sqrt{a_{1} a_{2} \\cdots a_{n+1}} \\text {. } \\] Now, if not all the numbers are equal, then \\(b>0\\), and the strict inequality holds. Third Solution (mathematical induction). Designate \\(a_{1}\\) by \\(b_{1}^{n}\\), and so on; then the inequality whose proof we seek takes on the form \\[ b_{1}^{n}+b_{2}^{n}+\\cdots+b_{n}^{n} \\geqq n b_{1} b_{2} \\cdots b_{n} \\] Suppose that this inequality is assumed to hold for any \\(n\\) positive numbers; we shall show that it holds for \\(n+1\\) numbers: \\[ b_{1}^{n+1}+b_{2}^{n+1}+\\cdots+b_{n}^{n+1}+b_{n+1}^{n+1} \\geqq(n+1) b_{1} b_{2} \\cdots b_{n+1} \\] Dividing both members of this inequality by \\(b_{n \\perp 1}^{n+1}\\), and designating \\(\\frac{b_{1}}{b_{n+1}}\\) by \\(c_{1}\\), and so on, yields \\[ c_{1}^{n+1}+c_{2}^{n+1}+\\cdots+c_{n}^{n \\mid 1}+1 \\geqq(n+1) c_{1} c_{2} \\cdots c_{n} \\] or, \\[ c_{1}^{n ! 1}+c_{2}^{n+1}+\\cdots+c_{n}^{n+1} \\geqq(n+1) c_{1} c_{2} \\cdots c_{n}-1 . \\] But by the induction hypothesis, \\[ c_{1}^{n+1}+c_{2}^{n+1}+\\cdots+c_{n}^{n+1} \\geqq n\\left(c_{1} c_{2} \\cdots c_{n}\\right)^{(n+1) / n} . \\] Hence it suffices to show that \\[ (n+1) c_{1} c_{2} \\cdots c_{n}-1 \\leqq n\\left(c_{1} c_{2} \\cdots c_{n}\\right)^{(n+1) / n} \\] or, designating \\(\\sqrt[n]{c_{1} c_{2} \\cdots c_{n}}\\) by \\(k\\), that \\[ (n+1) k^{n}-1 \\leqq n k^{n+1} . \\] The last inequality follows from the following computation: \\[ \\begin{aligned} & (n+1) k^{n}-1-n k^{n+1}=-n k^{n}(k-1)+\\left(k^{n}-1\\right) \\\\ & =(k-1)\\left(-n k^{n}+k^{n-1}+k^{n-2}+\\cdots+k+1\\right) \\\\ & =-(k-1)\\left[\\left(k^{n}-k^{n-1}\\right)+\\left(k^{n}-k^{n-2}\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(k^{n}-1\\right)\\right] \\\\ & =-(k-1)^{2}\\left[k^{n-1}+k^{n-2}(k+1)+\\cdots\\right. \\\\ & \\left.+k\\left(k^{n-2}+k^{n-3}+\\cdots+k+1\\right)+\\left(k^{n-1}+k^{n-2}+\\cdots+k+1\\right)\\right] \\leqq 0 \\end{aligned} \\] (for \\(k>0\\), the expression in brackets is clearly positive).

We now shall show that if the theorem is valid for \\(n+1\\) positive numbers, that is, if \\[ \\left(\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}+a_{n+1}}{n+1}\\right)^{2} \\leqq \\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}^{2}+a_{n+1}^{2}}{n+1} \\] then it holds for \\(n\\) numbers. Substituting in (1) \\[ a_{n+1}=\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n} \\] we obtain \\[ \\left(\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n}\\right)^{2} \\leqq \\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}^{2}+\\left(\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n}\\right)^{2}}{n+1} \\] (compare with the first solution of problem 268), from which we conclude that \\[ \\left(\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}}{n}\\right)^{2} \\leqq \\frac{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+\\cdots+a_{n}^{2}}{n} . \\] The remainder of the proof does not differ significantly from that of the first solution of problem 268. It is easily established that equality holds only if \\(a_{1}=a_{2}=\\cdots=a_{n}\\). (b) The validity of the inequality will first be established for two numbers; that is, we shall establish that \\[ \\left(\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}}{2}\\right)^{k} \\leqq \\frac{a_{1}^{k}+a_{2}^{k}}{2} \\] For \\(k=2\\) this inequality has already been proved [see \\(\\left(1^{\\prime}\\right)\\) of the discussion of Section 11 (Problems)]. Assume now that the inequality holds for some given \\(k\\). We have \\[ \\begin{aligned} & \\left(\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}}{2}\\right)^{k+1}=\\left(\\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}}{2}\\right)^{k} \\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}}{2}<\\frac{a_{1}^{k}+a_{2}^{k}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}}{2} \\\\ & \\quad=\\frac{a_{1}^{k+1}+a_{2}^{k+1}}{2}-\\frac{a_{1}^{k+1}+a_{2}^{k+1}-a_{1}^{k} a_{2}-a_{1} a_{2}^{k}}{4} \\\\ & \\quad=\\frac{a_{1}^{k+1}+a_{2}^{k+1}}{2}-\\frac{\\left(a_{1}^{k}-a_{2}^{k}\\right)\\left(a_{1}-a_{2}\\right)}{4} \\leqq \\frac{a_{1}^{k+1}+a_{2}^{k+1}}{2}, \\end{aligned} \\] from which it follows that the inequality holds for \\(k+1\\). By the principle of mathematical induction, the proposition holds for all natural numbers.

Below is a problem from the William Lowell Putnam competition and a possible solution.

Problem:
{problem}

Solution:
{solution}

A student is attempting to solve a Putnam problem. They are reasoning aloud as they progress. Your job is to rate their last reasoning step. Only the last step is rated.
Note that they haven't completed the problem yet; we are only grading them on current progress. Also note that the provided solution is only a template and there may be several ways to solve the problem.
The student's steps may meander or go down the wrong direction. This is fine as long as the student either admits they're wrong/stuck or corrects themselves eventually.
Ultimately we are only assessing the student's ability to reason through the problem and draw from relevant knowledge.

Grading:
- A positive step advances towards the solution (this is given a result of 1).
- A neutral step makes no progress towards the solution but isn't incorrect otherwise (this is given a result of 0).
- A negative step has a mistake that the student does not acknowledge, or concludes something that doesn't follow from previous steps (this is given a result of -1).

Student's Steps:
{steps_str}

Output your results in JSON with the following schema `{{step: step_num, explanation: explanation, result: result}}` where `step_num` is an integer, `explanation` is a brief explanation as a string, and `result` is an integer (-1, 0, or 1) indicating the rating of the step as above.
